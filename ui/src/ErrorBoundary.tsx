/**
 * Last-resort recovery surface for the double-click audience.
 *
 * The stated player has no terminal and no devtools, and the production build
 * is one self-contained file opened from `PLAY.bat`. Without a boundary, any
 * throw inside the React tree unmounts the whole app and leaves a black page
 * with no text — and because the journey that triggered it is still in
 * `localStorage`, every reload reproduces it, so the player has no way back at
 * all. `App`'s own fail-closed screen covers a save that fails to parse or
 * verify; it cannot cover a throw raised while a screen is being drawn.
 *
 * This module is deliberately dependency-free (React only). It must be able to
 * render when the rest of the UI cannot, so it reads no engine projection, no
 * content, and no save.
