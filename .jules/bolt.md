## 2025-05-18 - WeakMap caching of worldHash for frozen OverworldManifest
**Learning:** `hashState(world)` takes ~100ms on the large overworld manifest object because canonical serialization recursively sorts keys and formats JSON. When building `OverworldSessionIndexes`, this calculation was being re-run on every session initialization. Caching the result via a module-level `WeakMap` for `Object.isFrozen(world)` instances eliminates this ~100ms overhead for subsequent sessions with zero risk of stale data or memory leaks.
**Action:** Always check if heavy serialization or hashing functions are repeatedly invoked on immutable/frozen domain objects, and use a `WeakMap` cached by object identity.
