# The AdventureForge dev loop

> **This is one of two loops.** Playtesting runs separately and in parallel —
> see [`two_loop_workflow.md`](./two_loop_workflow.md). Either loop runs on any
> model.

An autonomous improvement loop that **constantly evaluates the next-best
improvement** across the whole project, makes one focused change per cycle, and
lands it under **trust-but-verify** (see `AGENTS.md`). It consumes quality
feedback as QA tickets produced asynchronously by the playtest loop; it does not
produce that feedback itself, and it never waits for it. It draws on the agent's broad knowledge to
_choose and craft_ improvements, and on the deterministic verification suite to
_prove_ they're correct.

## One cycle

```
loop.sh  (outer driver — orchestration + the bar)
│
├─ 0. QA BUCKET     npm run work -- --list  (the intake queue, which is what
│     report_qa_bucket actually shells out to; `npm run qa:bucket -- --summary` is the
│     operator-facing view of the ticket bucket behind it. Informational only: it can
│     never fail the cycle, and an empty queue is normal — the assessor's own
│     maintenance candidates carry the cycle)
│
├─ 1. ASSESS        npm run ai:loop → src/ai-loop.ts (uses src/afk/assessor.ts)
│     Deterministically scans every pack + repo signals and ranks
│     improvement candidates across four categories:
│        content_fix · content_new · engine · repo
│     Compiled feedback hot spots (docs/testing_pyramid.md), when present, are
│     a primary input to the ranking.
│     Emits: ai-runs/<id>/{assessment.md, prompt.md} plus latest-cycle.json at
│     the ai-runs/ root (which records the improvement source, fresh-overworld
│     playtest contract, report path, and ultraplan handoff path when applicable).
│
├─ 2. CRAWL GATE (pre)   npm run crawl:smoke — Tier 1 of the testing pyramid.
│     Must be green before the agent touches anything; red here means the
│     world was already broken, so the cycle halts and reverts (loop.sh).
│
├─ 3. WORK          the operating agent (first installed of codex/claude/gemini,
│     or AI_AGENT / AI_AGENT_CMD)
│     Reads the cycle prompt and:
│       a. ONE improvement — content edit / apply_content_patch, or an engine/repo
│          change (full authority; new mechanics need no §14 ceremony, but stay
│          verified). Bugs get a traces/bugs/ artifact + a tests/regression/ test.
│       b. FOCUSED CHECKS + LOCAL PROVISIONAL COMMIT — freezes every tracked
│          implementation change without pushing, then requires an exactly clean
│          `git status --porcelain`. Before freezing, the agent records the actual
│          chosen candidate id (or null for off-list work) in the scaffold's
│          machine-owned `feedback_cycle_selection` marker. This is the revision
│          the player will exercise.
│       c. NO PLAYTEST IN THIS LOOP — the dev cycle never plays the game and
│          cannot be failed for lacking a session. Experience evidence is
│          produced asynchronously by the playtest loop (playtest-loop.sh)
│          against the published build and enters LATER cycles as triaged
│          intake tickets (docs/two_loop_workflow.md). When pure cycle
│          artifacts DO exist under ai-runs/<runId>/, the seal verifies them
│          exactly as it always did — server evidence and the V2 receipt
│          independently cross-checked (docs/blind_playtest_protocol.md) —
│          and evidence or a sidecar published WITHOUT a report is rejected
│          as an incomplete publication. Direct quest starts and crawler/
│          smoke/mock modes are structural QA, never pure retention evidence.
│          Milestone/harvest fleets belong to the playtest loop
│          (`npm run fleet -- --count 100`, docs/testing_pyramid.md).
│       d. FEEDBACK + LEDGER — run `npm run feedback:status`, which verifies the
│          unseen ledger plus accepted pending-cycle cohort. Run `npm run
│          feedback:compile` only when it reports a one-time bootstrap or ≥3 new
│          actionable reports. Mocks remain accounted for but cannot trigger or
│          steer a compile. Complete AI_LOOP_STATE.md after the change; it must be
│          the only tracked change left outside the provisional commit.
│
├─ 4. CRAWL GATE (post)  npm run crawl:smoke again — a new finding here is a
│     regression the cycle itself just introduced; the cycle halts and reverts.
│
├─ 5. VERIFY        the bar, all blocking (a red gate reverts the cycle's scratch
│                    to the pre-cycle ref, skips the commit, and the outer loop
│                    continues under circuit breakers — see Failure handling):
│       npm run health            (verify:integrity + typecheck + lint +
│                                  format:check + tests + ui:typecheck + validate)
│       verify:integrity --against <pre-cycle ref>   (don't route around the verifier:
│                                                      hard-block only on weakening —
│                                                      deleted/disabled tests, dropped
│                                                      test count, or a re-pin with no
│                                                      content change; legit re-pins warn)
│       require_final_ledger_only  (only AI_LOOP_STATE.md may differ after the gates)
│       loop:seal-feedback         (verify any present cycle playtest artifacts —
│                                    optional since 2026-08-29, but an incomplete
│                                    publication fails closed; atomically promote
│                                    any compile manifest and queue this report)
│
└─ 6. FINALIZE/PUSH   commit only the completed, machine-sealed AI_LOOP_STATE.md
       after the outer bar passes. AI_LOOP_COMMIT=1 enables both the provisional
       implementation commit and this final ledger commit; AI_LOOP_PUSH=1 may push
       only afterward.
       Note: a bare push of fresh commits to protected
       main is always rejected (the required 'verify' check can't have run yet) —
       land loop commits via a scratch branch/PR and leave AI_LOOP_PUSH=0.
```

**Failure handling.** loop.sh refuses to start on a dirty tree (AI_LOOP_ALLOW_DIRTY=1
overrides commit-mode startup only, accepting the risk below). Each cycle snapshots
its exact non-ignored untracked paths. A red gate fails explicitly (`|| return 1`, not
`set -e`): tracked work and the provisional commit reset to the pre-cycle ref, and
only untracked paths absent from that snapshot are cleaned, across the whole repo.
Preexisting untracked paths are not intentionally deleted. Under the dirty override,
however, reset still destroys tracked edits and no cleanup can restore a preexisting
untracked file that the agent staged/committed, edited, moved, or removed. A
nonzero or timed-out agent turn is itself a failed cycle; partial output does not
fall through to the gates. Every failure is classified and appended atomically to
the bounded ignored `ai-runs/failure-ledger.json` history (100 entries by default),
which `npm run loop:status` displays even when no wrapper log was captured. The
outer loop continues until its circuit breakers stop it (5 consecutive / 15 total
failures by default).

**Feedback-compile ownership.** The prompted agent runs `npm run feedback:status`;
the command, not prose bookkeeping, verifies and counts stable report identities
against the last accepted manifest. With no flags, inputs are the local
`blind-tester/reports` ledger and cycle reports named in the committed acceptance marker
whose exact report/evidence/sidecar hashes still match. Crawler files remain explicit
`--in` evidence until they have an equivalent accepted-artifact receipt.
Existing report/receipt/provider gates still decide admission, and copied pure runs
count once. A no-flags compile ranks only the fresh actionable report delta;
explicit standalone inputs can also add crawler findings, while `retention.json`
remains a cumulative verified-corpus view. Deterministic structural mocks enter the seen/excluded partition so they cannot
retrigger, but never enter product hot spots or experience metrics.

Each compile writes a canonical, digest-bound `report-manifest.json`. That ignored
artifact is provisional: the assessor ignores it, as well as any newer or tampered
compile, until `loop:seal-feedback` promotes its exact digest into the tracked
`AI_LOOP_STATE.md` marker after every outer gate. The same seal consumes a feedback
recommendation only when the provisional commit's actual-selection attestation names
it (the assessor's offered recommendation is not authority) and queues the just-tested
pure report for a later cohort. This one-cycle lag prevents that canonical cycle
bundle from entering after a failed, reset, or uncommitted build and does not depend
on Git ancestry, so squash merges preserve identity. Fully verified fleet/legacy/smoke
ledger reports retain their existing local-ledger admission path. Ordinary explicit
compiler flags remain standalone forensic paths and never write an acceptance pointer;
the recovery-only `--rebootstrap` is the sole exception. If a tracked manifest
points to missing/corrupt ignored local artifacts, feedback reads fail closed; restore
the bundle or run `npm run feedback:rebootstrap`. That recovery command is refused
unless committed state already names an accepted compile whose exact ignored bundle
is unavailable or invalid; it cannot replace a healthy accepted compile or create the
initial baseline.
`loop.sh` does not count or invoke the compiler; it only performs the post-gate seal.

**Evidence-only mode.** With `AI_LOOP_COMMIT=0`, `npm run ai:loop` does not rotate or
append to the tracked loop ledger before the agent starts. The prompt requires an
exact-clean baseline pure play before any uncommitted edit. The later work can be
checked locally, but its baseline report must not be represented as evidence for that
uncommitted revision. The driver enforces a clean start again at every cycle boundary;
`AI_LOOP_ALLOW_DIRTY=1` cannot bypass that provenance gate. If a successful
evidence-only cycle leaves work uncommitted, continuous mode stops before launching
another baseline and tells the operator to commit, stash, or discard the pending work.

## Saturation-triggered ultraplan

The deterministic assessor is cheap and good at routine work, but it has no
strategic imagination: once every high-value lever has disarmed (content clean,
world quests at the breadth target, no engine/repo/frontier candidate), every remaining
candidate collapses to the **0.5 routine-blind-pass floor** — `isSaturated(a)` in
`src/afk/assessor.ts`. That is the diminishing-returns state that once pinned the
loop to clockwork-polish.

When the loop hits it, a cycle **re-aims with a bounded multi-agent ultraplan**
instead of spending another pass on polish:

```
ASSESS → isSaturated?  ── no ──▶ standard cycle (as above)
                       └─ yes, and off cooldown ──▶ ULTRAPLAN cycle:
   1. Workflow ultraplan (≈4-6 agents: LOCAL repo reviewers + synthesis — NO web
      researchers; web tools force an interactive approval prompt that stalls the
      unattended loop) picks the single highest-value STRUCTURAL move, grounded in
      docs/archive/ULTRAPLAN-*.md and docs/ROADMAP.md (advance them, don't restart).
   2. Writes the sole fresh-agent handoff to ignored
      ai-runs/<cycle>/current-plan.md; latest-cycle.json records it as
      currentPlanRecord. docs/CURRENT_PLAN.md remains a durable short router and is
      never overwritten by the loop.
   3. A FRESH implementation subagent reads ONLY that per-cycle handoff + the files
      it names (clean context, not the whole repo) and makes the one change.
   4. Same provisional-commit → exact-clean blind playtest → outer green bar →
      final ledger-commit sequence as every commit-enabled cycle.
```

**Cost control.** An ultraplan is multi-agent (≈4-6 agents) / multi-minute work, so it must not fire
every ~15-min cycle while saturation persists. A **cooldown** (`ai-runs/
saturation-state.json`, default 8 cycles, `AI_LOOP_ULTRAPLAN_COOLDOWN`) bounds it to
at most once per N cycles. Ultraplan cycles also get a larger agent budget
(`AI_LOOP_ULTRAPLAN_TIMEOUT_SECONDS`, default 3600s) via the per-cycle
`agentTimeoutSeconds` that `ai-loop.ts` writes into `latest-cycle.json`.

The fresh-context-per-phase shape is free here: each cycle's automatic agent is a new
agent process (`codex exec`, `claude -p`, `gemini`, or whatever `AI_AGENT_CMD` names),
and Step 3's implementer is a fresh subagent — so the plan is
handed off as a _document_, not a context window.

### The decision log (durable memory of settled questions)

The ignored per-cycle handoff is intentionally disposable, so it cannot remember what
was already ruled out across re-aims. `docs/DECISION_LOG.md` supplies that durable
memory: it is an **append-only** ledger of settled questions.
Each ultraplan reads it first and treats its "Confirmed CLOSED" list as a hard boundary for
every reviewer subagent (do not re-nominate or re-investigate a closed gap — the file:line
proof is recorded), then appends the gaps it confirmed closed this cycle. This is the missing
fourth piece of the reviewer subagent contract — _objective · output format · tool guidance ·
**boundaries**_ — and the cure for redundant fan-out across re-aims.

## Why this shape (grounded in 2025–26 practice)

- **Hard, machine-readable verification gate + "don't route around the verifier"**
  are the two highest-value techniques for unattended loops (Anthropic
  long-running-agents harness; EvilGenie reward-hacking benchmark). We enforce both:
  `npm run health` is the gate, and `scripts/verify-integrity.ts` makes
  test-weakening / silent hash re-pins fail loudly.
- **Evidence-driven work selection** (not a hand-fed TODO list): the assessor turns
  real signals — validator warnings, thin modes, engine TODOs, missing tooling,
  generated-pack drift — into a ranked backlog, so the loop always works the
  highest-value thing and a human can see _why_.
- **An LLM playtest is the quality oracle, one of three tiers, one oracle chain —
  see docs/testing_pyramid.md.** Dev tests (validators + exhaustive solver) prove
  _structure_ (every ending reachable, no soft-locks, sound scoring); the mechanical
  crawler (`crawl:smoke`/`crawl:deep`) sweeps every quest and the overworld for
  mechanical defects with zero LLM cost; a reasoning agent playing the same
  game-native contract as a human measures the _experience_, including its real
  continue/end retention choice, and the feedback compiler
  turns both crawler findings and blind reports into ranked hot spots. The crawl
  gate is mandatory around every change. The blind playtest is **not** a per-cycle
  gate — that coupling is exactly what the two-loop split removed
  (`docs/two_loop_workflow.md`), and as of 2026-08-29 the removal is complete on
  both sides: `require_playtest_record` is gone from `loop.sh`, the cycle prompt no
  longer asks for a blind run, and `loop:seal-feedback` treats the cycle playtest
  artifacts as optional — verifying them in full when they are present, sealing the
  acceptance marker alone when they are not.
- **Externalized state + one change per cycle**: `AI_LOOP_STATE.md` is the durable
  history; `ai-runs/<id>/` holds ignored per-cycle evidence, playtest report, and any
  ultraplan fresh-agent handoff.

## Running it

```bash
npm run assess          # just print the ranked next-best-improvement backlog
npm run ai:loop         # one cycle: assess + emit the cycle prompt + artifacts
./loop.sh --once        # full cycle (pre-crawl → change/provisional/play → outer gates → ledger commit)
./loop.sh               # continuous (AI_LOOP_MAX_CYCLES, AI_LOOP_DELAY_SECONDS to bound)
npm run loop:status     # project-scoped status + durable latest failure; optional
npm run loop:stop       #   velocity telemetry uses: ./loop.sh 2>&1 | tee ai-runs/wrapper.log

npm run crawl:smoke               # the crawl gate itself, run standalone (docs/testing_pyramid.md)
npm run blind                     # canonical pure player, fresh overworld
npm run fleet -- --count 100      # milestone/harvest pure fleet (real tokens)
npm run fleet:mock -- --count 2   # explicit structural, zero-token dry run
npm run feedback:status           # verify/count the accepted uncompiled cohort
npm run feedback:compile          # when status says ready; writes delta + manifest
npm run feedback:rebootstrap      # recovery only: replace a missing/corrupt accepted bundle
```

`loop.sh` installs missing root and UI dependencies before starting cycles because
`npm run health` includes `ui:typecheck`.

The scheduled deep audit wraps the isolated `ending-render-proof` and standard
coverage suite with non-blocking performance warnings at 420 s and 4,200 s. It
caches the last five green durations per proof and also warns above 1.5× their
rolling median. These warnings never change the commands' exit status, hard job
timeouts, state caps, or proof completeness. The instrumented standard suite has
a coverage-command-only 300-second per-test ceiling for full-suite V8 worker
contention; ordinary standard tests retain their 60-second fail-fast ceiling.

Key env (loop.sh's header comment is the authoritative reference): `AI_LOOP_COMMIT=1`
to enable the local provisional and final-ledger commits, `AI_LOOP_PUSH=1` to push
(rejected against protected main — see the cycle
diagram), `AI_LOOP_DELAY_SECONDS` between cycles (default 10), `AI_AGENT=<id>` to pick a dev
agent (`codex`, `claude`, `gemini`) and `AI_AGENT_CMD` to set an explicit command for
anything else — otherwise the loop auto-detects the FIRST of those ids that is
installed, so the same checkout runs under whichever vendor a machine happens to have.
Asking for an agent that is absent fails loudly rather than silently substituting
another vendor, which would make the ledger claim work an agent never did. The outer
loop does not inspect local credential files or choose a fallback provider —
`AI_AGENT_TIMEOUT_SECONDS` (default 2400)
to hang-kill a stuck turn, `AI_LOOP_MAX_CONSECUTIVE_FAILURES` / `AI_LOOP_MAX_TOTAL_FAILURES`
for the circuit breakers, and `AI_LOOP_ALLOW_VERIFIER_EDITS=1` to acknowledge a
deliberate verifier change. `AI_LOOP_FAILURE_LEDGER_MAX_ENTRIES` bounds retained
failure records (default 100).

## Honest limits

- loop.sh requires the pure runner's sidecar-last publication, a schema-valid V2
  interview, an exact game receipt match, `tracked_worktree_clean: true`, and a
  build commit equal to provisional HEAD. This rejects empty, fabricated-shape,
  interrupted, dirty-build, and stale-revision artifacts. It still cannot prove
  the model's private motivation, but it does prove the recorded session followed
  the enforced player surface and ended through the game contract.
- The verifier-integrity guard catches _mechanical_ tampering (skip/delete/empty/
  re-pin), not _semantic_ weakening (a future LLM-judge could).
- The loop makes one change per cycle by design; broad multi-step work should be
  several cycles, each verified.
