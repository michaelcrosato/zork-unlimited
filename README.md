# AdventureForge

A headless, AI-authored text-adventure engine spanning CYOA, a Zork-style parser,
a Sierra-Quest scoring game, a Hero's-Quest RPG, and a React UI. See
[`ADVENTUREFORGE_BUILD_SPEC.md`](./ADVENTUREFORGE_BUILD_SPEC.md) for the original
design brief.

## Status

### Stage 0 — deterministic core ✅

The trustworthy spine every later stage sits on. No content in the engine — just a core
the AI can later author into but cannot corrupt.

| Piece | File |
|---|---|
| Unified `GameState` (§6) | `src/core/state.ts` |
| Condition DSL + evaluator (§7.1) | `src/core/conditions.ts` |
| Effect DSL + pure reducer (§7.1) | `src/core/effects.ts` |
| Event log (§8.3) | `src/core/events.ts` |
| Seeded PRNG (§4.1, §8.5) | `src/core/rng.ts` |
| Canonical state hash (§8.6) | `src/core/hash.ts` |
| Pure `step` reducer + `Rules` resolver (§8.1, §8.4) | `src/core/engine.ts` |
| Save / load with content-hash integrity (§8.7) | `src/persist/save_load.ts` |
| Trace record / replay (§8.8) | `src/trace/` |

The Layer-2/Layer-3 boundary (§3) is enforced by the `Rules` resolver: the engine asks
content what an action means, but contains no content itself.

### Stage 1 — CYOA engine ✅ (schema · validator · play CLI)

| Piece | File |
|---|---|
| CYOA schema (§7.2) | `src/cyoa/schema.ts` |
| Pack loader (YAML → validated JSON + content hash) | `src/cyoa/pack.ts` |
| Runner: pack → `Rules` resolver (§8.4) | `src/cyoa/runner.ts` |
| AI-/human-facing observation (§9.1) | `src/cyoa/observation.ts` |
| CYOA validator (§10.1) | `src/validate/cyoa_validator.ts` |
| Sample pack: *The Watchtower Road* (20 scenes, 3 endings) | `content/cyoa/pack/watchtower_road.yaml` |
| Negative fixtures that MUST fail (§10.4) | `content/broken-fixtures/` |

The validator checks reference integrity, reachability, ending reachability, soft-locks,
dead ends, flag/item feasibility, contradictions, and duplicate endings. Where flags/items
make a property undecidable in general it uses a documented conservative approximation
(see header comments) rather than silently checking something weaker.

### Stage 2 — Zork-style parser adventure ✅

The same Stage-0 core, now driving a parser game: rooms, objects, containers, locked
doors, an NPC dialogue tree, and USE puzzles — exposed to agents as a Jericho-style
**legal-action set**, never a raw parser to guess at.

| Piece | File |
|---|---|
| Parser schema (§7.3) | `src/parser/schema.ts` |
| World model: object location, containers, dialogue state | `src/parser/model.ts` |
| Legal-action generator + resolver (§9, §9.2) | `src/parser/legal_actions.ts` |
| Runner: pack → `Rules`, win conditions on room entry (§8.4) | `src/parser/runner.ts` |
| Parser observation (§9.2) | `src/parser/observation.ts` |
| Controlled human command parser (§9.3) | `src/parser/command_map.ts` |
| Parser validator (§10.2) | `src/validate/parser_validator.ts` |
| Sample pack: *The Sealed Crypt* (10 rooms, 8 objects, 2 containers, 2 locked doors, 1 NPC, 2 puzzles) | `content/parser/pack/sealed_crypt.yaml` |
| Negative fixtures that MUST fail (§10.4) | `content/broken-fixtures/parser_*.yaml` |
| 8-persona playtester roster (§12.8) | `agents/parser_playtester.ts`, `agents/parser_personas.ts` |
| Bug artifact + regression (§15) | `traces/bugs/bug_0001_*.yaml`, `tests/regression/parser_crypt_softlock.test.ts` |

Two small **additive** engine extensions went through the §14 gate: an
`ObjectRuntime.room` field and a `place_object` effect (both needed for DROP).
Every existing CYOA trace still replays to an identical hash.

The parser validator adds the §10.2 invariants on top of graph reachability:
locked-exit/locked-container key satisfiability, an item-obtainability fixpoint
(keys that unlock containers that hold keys…), `quest_critical` permanent-loss
guards (consumption and one-way-map drops), dialogue-tree termination, and
win reachability — each with a documented conservative approximation.

### Stage 3 — Sierra-Quest style (score · death/restore · puzzle chains) ✅

Same core again, now with a **score**, **death endings recoverable via load**, and
longer puzzle chains.

| Piece | File |
|---|---|
| Score (`inc_var` on a `score` var) + `max_score`, `ending.death` flag | `src/parser/schema.ts` |
| Validator extensions (§13 Stage 3) | `src/validate/parser_validator.ts` |
| Sample pack: *The Alchemist's Tower* (brew an antidote; a fatal black phial) | `content/parser/pack/alchemists_tower.yaml` |

Scoring is a conventional `score` var awarded via `inc_var`; death endings are
terminal non-win endings reached by an `end_game` effect, and are recoverable by
loading a pre-death save (§8.7). The validator adds **score reachability**
(`max_score` ≤ total awards), **`end_game` target declared**, **win-is-not-death**,
and **at-least-one-winnable-ending** — no engine change was needed.

### Stage 4 — Hero's-Quest RPG (stats · seeded combat · skill checks · quest stages) ✅

The same headless core, now with character stats, a seeded turn-based fight, and a
seeded d20 skill check — all through the **§14 engine-extension gate**, with every
roll flowing through the PRNG so fights replay exactly (§8.5).

| Piece | File |
|---|---|
| RPG schema (parser pack + enemies; `skill_check` on interactions) | `src/rpg/schema.ts` |
| Seeded combat + skill-check resolvers (randomness in the pure resolver) | `src/rpg/combat.ts` |
| RPG runner (parser actions + `ATTACK`) + observation | `src/rpg/runner.ts`, `src/rpg/observation.ts` |
| RPG validator (winnability, skill passability, stat/death-ending checks) | `src/validate/rpg_validator.ts` |
| Gated core DSL additions: `set_quest_stage` effect, `quest_stage` condition, `ATTACK` action | `src/core/`, `src/api/types.ts` |
| Sample pack: *The Sunken Barrow* | `content/rpg/pack/sunken_barrow.yaml` |
| Negative fixture (`COMBAT_UNWINNABLE`) | `content/broken-fixtures/rpg_unwinnable.yaml` |
| §14 gate record (all six items) | [`docs/stage4_rpg_gate.md`](./docs/stage4_rpg_gate.md) |
| Acceptance + unit + regression tests, recorded victory trace | `tests/`, `traces/rpg/barrow_victory.json` |

Stage 4 is **backward-compatible**: the additions are optional or top-level, so
every Stage 0–3 pack compiles to identical content (the CYOA content hash is
asserted unchanged) and every prior trace still replays.

### Stage 5 — Web UI (React + Vite) ✅

A **view** over the headless engine: it compiles a pack in-browser and drives the
same `step` reducer the CLI and MCP server use — one code path for CYOA, parser,
and RPG packs. The engine stays authoritative; the UI never decides legality.

| Piece | File |
|---|---|
| Browser engine client (one `GameSession` for all modes) | `ui/src/engine.ts` |
| React play view + pack picker | `ui/src/App.tsx`, `ui/src/packs.ts` |
| Pure-JS SHA-256 (makes the core browser-safe; byte-identical digests) | `src/core/sha256.ts` |
| Node test proving the UI uses only the structured API | `tests/unit/ui_engine.test.ts` |

```bash
npm run ui:dev     # http://localhost:5173 (after: npm --prefix ui install)
npm run ui:build   # production bundle in ui/dist
```

### Debugger + Fixer agents (§12.5, §15)

`agents/debugger.ts` replays a trace through the pure engine and classifies the
outcome (soft-lock / loop / unrecoverable death / rejected action / no failure),
then emits the §15 bug artifact. `agents/fixer.ts` proposes a **closed,
whitelisted** `ContentPatchProposal` that deterministic code applies and
re-validates — a model never edits files or runs shell (§16); a patch that breaks
the schema or fails validation is refused. Exposed over MCP as `apply_content_patch`.

### AI authoring — packs from prose (§11, §12.1–3)

A pack can be **authored from a one-line premise** by the writer → adapter →
validator loop. The writer drafts prose + beats; the adapter emits a CYOA pack and
classifies each beat against the engine contract (`content/engine_contract.yaml`,
§11); it loops against the validator until the report is green — the validator, not
the model, decides correctness (§16). The default `MockAuthorProvider` is
deterministic (no API keys); its first attempt ships a dangling reference and
self-corrects once the validator's errors are fed back. A real provider slots in
behind an env var (§12.7).

```bash
npm run author -- "A keeper must relight a dead lighthouse before a ship wrecks."
```

The same pipeline is exposed over MCP as the `adapt_story` tool.

## Content library (9 packs)

The shipped, validated content — every pack passes the validator and is wired into
`npm run health`:

| Mode | Pack | File |
|---|---|---|
| CYOA | The Watchtower Road | `content/cyoa/pack/watchtower_road.yaml` |
| CYOA | The Clockwork Heist | `content/cyoa/pack/clockwork_heist.yaml` |
| CYOA | The Wrecker's Light | `content/cyoa/pack/wreckers_light.yaml` |
| CYOA | The White Stag | `content/cyoa/pack/white_stag.yaml` |
| CYOA | The Tithe-Barn | `content/cyoa/pack/tithe_barn.yaml` |
| Parser | The Sealed Crypt | `content/parser/pack/sealed_crypt.yaml` |
| Parser | The Alchemist's Tower | `content/parser/pack/alchemists_tower.yaml` |
| RPG | The Sunken Barrow | `content/rpg/pack/sunken_barrow.yaml` |
| RPG | The Cold Forge | `content/rpg/pack/cold_forge.yaml` |

Most of this library — plus engine refinements like reactive room/scene descriptions
(`variants`), an opt-in `meta.deadline` timer, and natural USE-verbs — was produced
by the autonomous improvement loop (see [`docs/afk_loop.md`](./docs/afk_loop.md)),
each change blind-playtested and gated green.

## Quickstart

```bash
npm install
npm run typecheck                                        # tsc --noEmit
npm run lint                                             # ESLint
npm run format:check                                     # Prettier (use `npm run format` to fix)
npm test                                                  # unit + property tests
npm run replay                                            # Stage 0: round-trip a trace
npm run validate -- content/cyoa/pack/watchtower_road.yaml # Stage 1: validate a pack
npm run play -- content/cyoa/pack/watchtower_road.yaml     # Stage 1: play it (interactive)
npm run validate -- content/parser/pack/sealed_crypt.yaml  # Stage 2: validate the parser pack
npm run play:parser -- content/parser/pack/sealed_crypt.yaml # Stage 2: play it (interactive)
npm run playtest:parser -- content/parser/pack/sealed_crypt.yaml # Stage 2: the §12.8 roster
npm run play:parser -- content/parser/pack/alchemists_tower.yaml  # Stage 3: score + death/restore
npm run validate -- content/rpg/pack/sunken_barrow.yaml    # Stage 4: validate the RPG pack
npm run play:rpg -- content/rpg/pack/sunken_barrow.yaml     # Stage 4: play it (combat + skill check)
npm run inspect -- content/rpg/pack/sunken_barrow.yaml      # summarize a pack (or a trace)
npm run author -- "your one-line premise here"             # author a pack from prose (§12.1-3)
npm run ui:dev                                             # Stage 5: web UI (after npm --prefix ui install)
```

Non-interactive play (scriptable / CI): for CYOA add `--choices id1,id2,...`; for the
parser/RPG add `--commands "go north; take rope; attack wight; ..."`. Both accept
`--record traces/run.json` to save a replayable trace. `npm run validate` and
`npm run inspect` auto-detect CYOA vs parser vs RPG packs.

### MCP server — how an agent plays the game (§9.4)

The engine is exposed as an MCP server so any agent harness (Claude Code, Codex,
Gemini CLI, …) plays via native tool calls over the structured observation/action
loop — never a raw parser. **The tools are multi-mode**: the same `new_game` /
`step_action` / `get_observation` / `run_playtest` / `validate_pack` / save·load /
replay path plays CYOA, parser, and RPG packs — mode is auto-detected from the
pack's structure (never a field in content, §16) and carried on every observation
as `mode`. Tools: `validate_pack`, `load_pack`, `new_game`, `get_observation`,
`list_legal_actions`, `step_action`, `save_game`, `load_game`, `run_playtest`,
`replay_trace`, `inspect_trace` (per-step summary + suspected bugs),
`apply_content_patch` (deterministic, whitelisted patch — cyoa/parser),
`adapt_story` (author a pack from a premise). `list_stories` discovers packs
across `content/{cyoa,parser,rpg}/pack` with each pack's mode. All paths are
confined to the project root; content and traces are data only (§16). The handlers
(`src/mcp/tools.ts`) are unit-tested directly without a live client.

```bash
npm run mcp   # start the stdio server
```

The project ships `.mcp.json`, so an MCP client opened in this repo can connect
automatically (approve the `adventureforge` server when prompted). The agent loop is:
`new_game` → read `observation.available_actions` → `step_action` with a chosen
`action_id` → repeat until `observation.ended`.

### AI playtester loop (§12.4, §12.7)

A provider-agnostic LLM client (`agents/llm/provider.ts`) with a deterministic
**MockProvider** default — so the playtester runs in CI with no API keys. The
playtester (`agents/playtester.ts`) drives the same observation/action loop an
external agent uses, records each turn (§12.6), and a persona roster aggregates
route coverage and surfaces honest, non-fabricated findings.

```bash
npm run playtest -- content/cyoa/pack/watchtower_road.yaml [--out traces/playtests]
```

On *The Watchtower Road* the mock roster (5 personas × 8 seeds) reaches
`ending_escape` and `ending_captured` but **not** `ending_truth`, and never visits
the hidden cache or hermit conversation — a genuine playtest finding: the "good"
ending is hard to discover without in-world signposting (§17 rule 1). That gap is
the natural input to the next step: debugger → fixer → regression test (§12.5, §15).

### Parser playtester roster (§12.8)

Eight deterministic personas (mainline, curious, hoarder, dropper, dialogue-skipper,
wrong-order, adversarial, speedrunner) drive the same structured legal-action loop an
external agent uses. On *The Sealed Crypt* the heuristic roster reaches 8/10 rooms and
**wins nothing** — the route needs multi-step planning the heuristics don't do (honest;
winnability is certified by the walkthrough acceptance test and the validator). During
development the `dropper`/`wrong_order` personas wedged in a one-way crypt — a genuine
soft-lock now fixed and locked by `bug_0001` (§15).

```bash
npm run playtest:parser -- content/parser/pack/sealed_crypt.yaml [--out traces/playtests]
```

## Status: all stages complete ✅

Stages 0–5 are implemented and green — the full proof path from a deterministic
core, through CYOA, a Zork-style parser, a Sierra-Quest scoring/death game, a
Hero's-Quest RPG (stats + seeded combat + skill checks via the §14 gate), to a
React web UI that is a pure view over the same headless engine. The complete loop
from the thesis — AI writes a story → adapts it to a validated pack → the engine
validates it → an AI plays every route through the structured legal-action API →
records its experience → a debugger finds a flaw → a fixer patches it → a
regression test locks the fix — is exercised end to end, with the determinism
contract (§8.5) holding across every recorded trace.

`npm run health` (typecheck + tests + validate + playtest) is the verification
bar — the autonomous loop and CI must leave it green (trust, but verify; see
`AGENTS.md`). Provider-agnostic LLM access (`agents/llm/`) defaults to a
deterministic mock, so everything runs with no API keys; real
OpenAI/Anthropic/Google backends sit behind env vars (§12.7).
