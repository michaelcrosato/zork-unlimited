/**
 * Ingest a playtest session that the runner did not launch.
 *
 * This is the path for vendors that ship no headless CLI — today that means Grok, and
 * tomorrow it means whatever arrives before its tooling does. A human plays through a
 * desktop or web client wired to the AdventureForge MCP server, saves the transcript
 * and the exit interview, and this turns them into a first-class session record in the
 * same corpus the automated cohorts write to.
 *
 * The one thing it will not do is lie about provenance. A session ingested this way is
 * stamped `operator_attested`, and the attestation naming who vouched for the tool
 * boundary is REQUIRED, not optional. Such a session counts fully toward bug
 * corroboration and frequency — a human playing the real game is a real player — but it
 * is excluded from experience METRICS by `countsTowardExperienceMetrics`, because no
 * code in this repo watched that client and none can claim it was blind.
 *
 * Usage:
 *   npm run playtest:ingest -- \
 *     --provider grok_desktop --model grok-4-fast --persona cynical_veteran \
 *     --seed 1234 --game-session-id o-… \
 *     --transcript run.jsonl --report report.md \
 *     --attested-by "michael" --method "desktop client, AdventureForge MCP only"
