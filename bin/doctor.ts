/**
 * Report ground truth about what this machine can actually run, and why the corpus is
 * or is not producing work.
 *
 * This exists because of a specific failure. The documentation asserted "nothing in this
 * repo privileges a vendor" and offered a worked cohort in which most players could not
 * launch at all; separately, a whole two-loop exercise produced 55 findings and promoted
 * none of them, for reasons no command would tell you. Both were discoverable only by
 * running the thing and reading source afterwards. An operator planning a cohort should
 * not have to do that.
 *
 * So this answers three questions, in the order they bite:
 *
 *   1. Which vendors can I actually launch here, and which must be hand-played?
 *   2. What is in the corpus, and is it the SHAPE that can promote?
 *   3. If nothing is queued, why not — and what specifically would change it?
 *
 * Question 3 is the one that matters. "Nothing promoted" is the correct outcome for a
 * single-vendor corpus and also the symptom of a broken pipeline, and those look
 * identical from outside. This names which one you are looking at.
 *
 * Read-only: it never writes to the corpus, the bucket, or the queue.
 *
 * Usage:
 *   npm run doctor                       # uses the default corpus and queue
 *   npm run doctor -- --store /d/af-corpus
