/**
 * Mode-agnostic exhaustive ending-reachability solver (shared by parser and RPG
 * structural-verification suites).
 *
 * The engine (src/core/engine.ts) is content-free: it asks a `Rules` resolver for the
 * legal-action set of a state and for what each action means. `rules.legalActions(state)`
 * is, by the engine's own contract, the GROUND TRUTH legality set — the exact set
 * `makeStep` validates an action against — so a breadth-first search that, from each
 * reachable state, steps the legal actions and dedupes on a total state fingerprint
 * explores the concrete reachable region of a pack, regardless of mode (parser
 * verb-object commands and RPG combat actions both surface here as `Action`s). This is
 * the dynamic ground truth the validators' conservative static reachability check only
 * approximates.
 *
 * Soundness rests on three properties of the modes this serves:
 *   1. DETERMINISM / ROLL BRACKETING — `resolve` is pure for a given rules object
 *      (same state + action + roll stream ⇒ same result). Parser and RPG can carry
 *      routing-relevant skill checks, and RPG also has combat; their
 *      structural callers use `exhaustiveEndingsMulti` with rule sets that force the player's
 *      best/worst rolls, so one fingerprint can expose both success and failure transitions.
 *      See parser_rolls.ts and rpg_all_endings_reachable.test.ts. (RPG winnability under
 *      WORST rolls stays proven separately by the combat-bound checks, src/validate/
 *      rpg_validator.ts; this proves ROUTE EXISTENCE — every declared ending is reachable
 *      under SOME play.)
 *   2. FINITENESS — the fingerprint collapses interchangeable states, and every shipped
 *      pack's vars are bounded, so the visited set is finite and the BFS terminates.
 *      The MAX_STATES
 *      caller-supplied cap is only a backstop: a future unbounded-var pack trips it and
 *      the caller FAILS on `cappedOut`, so the search can never silently pass by
 *      truncating an unexplored region.
 *   3. MONOTONE ACTION RESTRICTION — the parser verb×object space is dominated by
 *      REVERSIBLE / inert moves (drop an item, close a door, look around) that explode the
 *      state count (an item dropped in each of N rooms, every inventory subset) without
 *      ever being NEEDED to reach an ending. The search therefore steps only "progress"
 *      actions (see `isProgressAction`), skipping drop/close and the pure-observation
 *      verbs. This is sound for a REACHABILITY proof because restricting the action set is
 *      monotone: any ending still reached is reached by a real, legal playthrough using a
 *      SUBSET of the game's actions, so it is genuinely reachable in the full game. The
 *      only thing a restriction can do is HIDE an ending that truly requires a dropped/
 *      closed item or an authored observation interaction — and that surfaces as a declared
 *      ending going unreached, i.e. a LOUD test failure, never a silent pass. Mode-specific
 *      callers that prove score/menu/variant completeness widen `explore` to retain such
 *      stateful actions. (Shipped packs gate every transition on
 *      has_item / visited / flags / is_unlocked; `not_item`/drop appear only in reactive
 *      prose `when:` variants, never on a route — so no ending needs a drop.)

/**

 * away without ever pruning a still-distinct branch:
 *   - `current`     — the scene/room the player stands in.
 *   - `visited`     — the set of places seen (parser wins gate on `{visited: room}`).
 *   - `flags`       — boolean switches.
 *   - `inventory`   — carried object ids.
 *   - `vars`        — every numeric var (CYOA's `ticks`, the parser `score`).
 *   - `objectState` — per-object open/locked/contents/location (a parser puzzle's whole
 *                     point: an opened chest is a DIFFERENT state from a closed one even
 *                     when flags/inventory are untouched — omitting this collapses the
 *                     two and the BFS can never explore "the chest is now open").
 *   - `questStage`  — Stage-3 quest progress, readable by conditions.
 *   - `ended`/`endingId` — distinguishes terminal states (and which ending fired).
 *
 * Deliberately EXCLUDED: `step` (a monotonic action counter — including it would make
 * every state unique and defeat dedupe entirely; it affects nothing in the deterministic
 * CYOA/parser modes this serves, and the RNG-bearing RPG mode is out of scope) and
 * `journal` (append-only player-facing narration that no condition reads, and which is
 * path-dependent, so including it would likewise prevent all dedupe).

 * Optional knobs on the search, all defaulting to the reachability-tuned behaviour so

 *     that is sound for the every-ending-reachable PROOF (restricting actions can only
 *     HIDE an ending → a loud failure, never invent one). That restriction is NOT sound
 *     for a LIVENESS proof, where skipping a state that displays a variant would FALSELY
 *     call the variant dead (a false positive). The parser variant-liveness caller
 *     therefore widens the policy to step every action EXCEPT those that provably cannot
 *     gate a variant (the pure-observation verbs and DROP — see that test's header), so
 *     a variant is called dead only when the reachable region genuinely never displays
 *     it. (READ in particular carries interaction `effects` — e.g. a `read_recipe` flag —
 *     so it is NOT pure narration and a liveness search must step it; the reachability
 *     search skips it soundly only because no ROUTE gates on a read flag, just reactive
 *     prose. RPG authored INSPECT effects similarly ride on LOOK, so RPG score/variant/menu
 *     callers restore only target looks backed by an INSPECT interaction.)
 *   - `key` — the dedupe fingerprint. Defaults to `stateKey`.
 *   - `onEdge` — observe every TRANSITION the search produces, as a `(fromKey, toKey)`
 *     pair of state fingerprints, INCLUDING edges into already-seen states (which the BFS
 *     would otherwise drop on the dedupe check). Lets a caller reconstruct the full
 *     reachable transition graph — e.g. to run a backward-liveness fixpoint proving every
 *     reachable state can still reach a terminal (no dynamic soft-lock pocket — see
 *     no_dead_pocket.test.ts). Default undefined: when omitted NO edge work is done and the
 *     search is byte-for-byte the original BFS, so every existing caller is unchanged.

 * the rolls their combat/skill resolver draws. Parser callers pass best/worst d20 skill
 * checks; RPG callers pass best/worst combat+skill regimes. Because the routing-relevant
 * consequence is monotonic in those rolls — did the d20 meet the difficulty, did the enemy
 * reach 0 HP, did the player reach 0 HP — the two extremes bracket every outcome a middle
 * roll could produce, so any ending reachable under SOME rolls is reached here (and
 * conversely every state visited is a real, legal playthrough on real die values, so
 * nothing spurious is reached). See parser_all_endings_reachable.test.ts and
 * rpg_all_endings_reachable.test.ts for the mode-specific soundness arguments.
 *
 * `legalActions` does NOT depend on the roll (legality is rng-independent in every mode), so
 * the legal set is taken from the first rule set and each action is stepped under all of
 * them; a rejected step (e.g. an action a regime makes unavailable) is simply skipped. For a
 * single deterministic rule set this is identical to the original single-rules BFS — the
