/**
 * Legal-action memoization by immutable state identity.
 *
 * `makeStep` defensively re-checks membership in `rules.legalActions(state)` on
 * every transition (engine.ts §8.4.1). A BFS that enumerates a state's actions and
 * then steps each one therefore enumerates the same state once for the loop plus
 * once per (action × rule set) — measured on `gallowmere` as 35,261 `legalActions`
 * invocations for 6,851 states, a 5.1× multiple. The enumeration itself is the
 * expensive part: it probes every verb against every visible object and runs a full
 * `resolveRpgAction` + condition evaluation per candidate.
 *
 * Engine states are immutable and each is visited once, so object identity is a
 * sound cache key and a WeakMap releases the entry with the state graph.
 *
 * Sharing one cache across several rule sets is licensed by the invariant the
 * exhaustive solver already documents: legality is RNG-independent in every mode, so
 * a best-roll and a worst-roll regime see the same legal set for the same state. The
 * cache is per-search, never global: a caller that mutates a pack between searches
 * gets a fresh map rather than a stale answer.
 *
 * This is the same trick `rpg_metamorphic_observation_stream.test.ts` used inline to
 * make its four-way regime comparison affordable; the solver had the identical need.
