/**
 * Read a numeric var, with an unwritten name reading as 0 (§7.1) — the semantics

 * (PHANTOM_VAR, IMPOSSIBLE_GATE).
 *
 * The bracket read has to be own-property-checked because `vars` is a plain
 * object and CONTENT controls the name: `set_var: { name: "__proto__" }` is
 * schema-valid (effects.ts spells the name as `z.string().min(1)`), and on any
 * vars object without an own `__proto__` key the plain read resolves the
 * INHERITED Object.prototype accessor instead. That value is an object, so the
 * usual `?? 0` fallback never fires: `inc_var` computed `prior + by` as the
 * string "[object Object]5", `guardFinite` rejected it and wrote the prototype
 * object back into a `Record<string, number>`, and the next `save()` died with
 * SaveIntegrityError ("vars.__proto__ expected number, received object") — a hard
 * crash for the MCP save path and the crawler's PERSIST oracle. Reading the same
 * name through a gate was wrong in both directions at once: on a fresh state both
 * `var_gte >= 1` and `var_lte <= 0` evaluated FALSE, which no unwritten var may do.
 *
 * Writes need no matching care: a COMPUTED key in an object literal
 * (`{ ...vars, [name]: value }`) defines an own data property rather than
 * invoking the legacy `__proto__` setter. So the numeric read path was the last
 * unguarded corner of the reserved-name hardening core already does in
 * `hash.ts` (bug_0247), `initState` and `cloneGameState`.
