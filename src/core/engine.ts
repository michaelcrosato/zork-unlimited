 * ENGINE — the pure reducer (spec §8.1, §8.4, §8.5).

 * `step` is the one public engine function. It must not mutate its input, must
 * not perform I/O, and must not read any clock or global RNG. All randomness
 * flows through the seeded PRNG (core/rng.ts) derived from state.seed/state.step.
 *
 * Content lives OUTSIDE the engine. The engine asks a `Rules` resolver what an
 * action means in the current state — Stage 1 (CYOA) and Stage 2 (parser) each
 * supply their own resolver over the same core. This is the Layer-2/Layer-3
 * boundary (§3): the single most important invariant in the system.
