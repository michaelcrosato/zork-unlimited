/**
 * Deterministic issue clustering — the analytical core of the feedback
 * compiler. NO LLM anywhere in this path: every grouping decision is a pure
 * function of issue content (canonical location, severity, tokenized text),
 * never of input array order or any external judgment call.
 *
 * Pipeline (see `clusterIssues` below):
 *   1. Sort issues canonically (locationKey, severity, normalized text, ref)
 *      so nothing downstream ever depends on the order the caller happened
 *      to supply issues in.
 *   2. Pass 1 — exact fingerprint buckets on (locationKey, severityBand,
 *      first 6 tokens). Cheap and coarse: two issues land in the same bucket
 *      only when their tokenized fingerprints match exactly.
 *   3. Pass 2 — repeatedly merge any two buckets that share a locationKey and
 *      whose token sets are ALL pairwise >= JACCARD_MERGE_THRESHOLD similar,
 *      iterating to a fixpoint. Every pair, not just the two clusters' blended
 *      unions: comparing unions would make this single-link agglomeration, where
 *      two issues that share nothing land in one cluster because a third sits
 *      between them (see `everyMemberPairSimilar`). The merge direction
 *      (lexicographically-smaller key always folds into the larger) means the
 *      surviving key of any merged group is simply the max of that group's
 *      original bucket keys. Combined with step 1, the whole pipeline is a pure
 *      function of the *set* of input issues, never their order (see the "input
 *      order never changes the clustering" test).

 * similarity ran 0.219 to 0.429, so at 0.5 they produced four tickets at one report
 * each. Corroboration — the rung the whole two-loop split exists to reach — could
 * therefore never fire on genuinely independent prose, only on near-duplicate text.
 *
 * Measured both directions on that same real material:
 *
 *   same defect, four independent wordings   0.219 – 0.429   must merge
 *   different defects (incl. cross pairs)    0.000 – 0.043   must not merge
 *
 * A gap of 0.175 separates them, and 0.15 sits inside it — comfortably above the
 * highest false pair and below the lowest true one. It is a threshold on token bags,
 * so it will never be exact; what makes it safe is that pass 2 only ever compares
 * issues that ALREADY share a canonical location, so the question being asked is the
 * narrow "are these two reports about the same thing in the same place?"
 *
 * Verified end to end on both sides: four real wordings of one defect now form a single
 * ticket at report_count 4, while three genuinely different defects filed against one
