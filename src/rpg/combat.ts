/**
 * Deterministic combat + skill-check resolution (spec §13 Stage 4, §14).
 *
 * These produce ordinary core effects from SEEDED rolls, so the engine's pure
 * reducer applies them unchanged and the determinism contract (§8.5) holds: the
 * PRNG is derived from (state.seed, state.step), and the engine advances `step`
 * after each action, so successive rounds draw independent, replayable streams.
 * No `Math.random`, no clock. A whole fight is reproducible from its trace.
 *
 * Combat is one ATTACK = one round: the player strikes; if the enemy survives it
 * strikes back. Damage = d6 + attacker.attack − defender.defense (min 1). A
 * defeated enemy fires its `on_defeat` effects; a fallen player hits `end_game`
 * on the enemy's death ending (recoverable via an earlier save, §8.7).

 * string mirrors the skill-check narration's transparent `rolled X + bonus`
 * format so a player can SEE the attack and defense at work: the same d6 roll
 * lands for less when the defender is better armoured, which is the only way the
 * player perceives that gear (e.g. the cold-iron plate's +2 defense) is doing
 * anything — a blind playtester flagged that the plate "felt invisible" because
 * the old narration showed only the final number, swamped by d6 variance
 * (bug_0131; the same is true of the barrow ward, cf. bug_0119). The `min 1`
 * floor is stated honestly when a blow is blunted to it, so the shown breakdown
 * can never silently fail to add up to the damage dealt.
