 * object `variants[].name`, a dialogue node, a pressure band label, or a skill
 * check's `stakes` renders straight to the player and is never emitted as a
 * narration event, so nothing else in the pipeline could see it either — the
 * schemas only require `min(1)` strings. Every field below is text a player
 * reads. Prefixes are per-site so the finding fingerprint
 * (`src/crawl/findings.ts`) dedupes each site independently; the original four
 * prefixes are unchanged so existing fingerprints still match.
 *
 * Deliberately NOT scanned: `state.journal` (it only grows, so re-scanning the
 * whole log every step is quadratic in a long crawl, and journal prose is
 * written by effects that narrate the same text), `inventory` and `state.flags`
 * (ids, not prose), and `exits[].direction` (compass tokens).

/**
 * Deterministically synthesize an action NOT in the legal set, for the

 * never silently accepted or thrown). Draws uniformly from EVERY illegal
 * candidate the current state affords, across three families: an unlisted MOVE
 * direction, a TAKE of an item that is not currently offered or held, and —
 * only while mid-dialogue — an ASK of a topic id no live topic uses. Returns
 * null only when none of the three can be built at all.
 *
 * This used to be an ordered fallback chain (MOVE first, TAKE only if every
 * compass direction was already legal, ASK only if that failed too). No shipped
 * room has all twelve directions legal at once, so the later legs were
 * unreachable for real content and the oracle only ever probed movement
 * rejection — never a TAKE of an absent object, never a dead dialogue topic,
 * which is exactly where a resolver is likelier to accept something it should
 * not. Pooling the candidates and picking once fixes the coverage without
 * costing determinism, and deliberately keeps the rng draw to EXACTLY ONE
 * `rng.int` per call, as the old first-branch-wins shape did in practice: this
 * generator shares its `Rng` with the crawl's action policy, so any change in
 * how many values it consumes would shift every subsequent policy pick and
 * silently re-route the whole crawl. The ASK sentinel is therefore derived by
 * lengthening a fixed prefix until it is unused, not by drawing a random suffix.
