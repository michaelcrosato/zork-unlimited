/**
 * Quest solver — BFS with parent pointers over CONCRETE play, used by the
 * overworld crawler (Task 8) to prove a quest round trip can actually be
 * completed: start it, play it through to a genuine (non-death) ending, then
 * hand the ending back to `OverworldSession.completeQuest`.
 *
 * Deliberately distinct from `src/solve/exhaustive_endings.ts`'s
 * `exhaustiveEndingsMulti` (which proves REACHABILITY under a best/worst-roll
 * bracket and returns no path): this solver steps `prepared.rules` AS SHIPPED
 * (the same rules real play uses, with the default seeded runtime rng —
 * `rngForRuntimeState`, a pure function of `(state.seed, state.step)`), and
 * reconstructs the actual action sequence a player would need to press to
 * reach the ending it finds — that sequence is exactly what the overworld
 * crawler replays to complete the quest.
 *
 * Dedupe uses the same `stateKey` fingerprint `exhaustiveEndingsMulti` uses
 * (excludes `step`, so equivalent states collapse) — sound here for the same
 * reason it's sound there: shipped RPG packs are already proven winnable
 * under worst-case rolls (see rpg_all_endings_reachable.test.ts), so some
 * legal, deterministic playthrough reaching a non-death ending is expected to
 * exist and be found well within a generous state cap.
 *
 * The search skips reversible and inert observation actions, but retains a
 * target LOOK when it carries an authored INSPECT interaction: those natural
 * looks can set flags or award score and therefore are gameplay decisions, not
 * pure refreshes. Dropping inert reads keeps the reachable region tractable
 * (with the full action set, dawn_beacon blows past 60k states without finding
 * an ending). Any path found remains genuine, fully legal play.
