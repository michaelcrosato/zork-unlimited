/**
 * Quest crawler — the zero-LLM mechanical game-crawler's stepping loop.
 *
 * Drives a `PreparedQuest` through many seeded episodes with a policy-driven
 * action choice, running these oracles:
 *   - CRASH      a THROW out of enumerate/resolve/render is an engine bug, never
 *                a silent propagation — caught, recorded with a lazy repro trace.
 *   - INTEGRITY  `assertRpgStateReferences` must hold after every accepted step.
 *   - LEGALITY   a listed-legal action must never be rejected; a sampled
 *                NOT-legal action must always be rejected cleanly (no throw, no
 *                state change).
 *   - RENDER     the observation + event text the player would actually see must
 *                never leak an unresolved template, "undefined", "[object
 *                Object]", "NaN", or empty text.
 *   - PERSIST    a save→load roundtrip of a live state must reproduce a
 *                byte-identical hash (§8.7); a throw is itself a finding.
 *   - DESYNC     replaying an episode's recorded actions from a fresh init state
 *                must reproduce the SAME per-step hash stream the live run saw —
 *                catches hidden non-determinism/mutable state a repro trace could
 *                never actually reproduce.
 *   - SOFTLOCK   two forms: an immediate S4 (live, non-ended state with zero legal
 *                actions) and an end-of-episode S3 solver form (an exhaustive
 *                best/worst-roll search from the post-episode state proves no
 *                declared ending is reachable; a capped-out search is unproven and
 *                never a finding).
 *
 * Repro traces are built LAZILY — only when a finding's fingerprint is genuinely
 * new (`addFinding`'s `collector.has` pre-check), never per step and never for a
 * fingerprint `collector.add` would just dedupe away, since throughput matters
 * over many episodes.
