/**
 * Promote a QA ticket into an intake submission.
 *
 * This is the seam between the rich, playtest-specific evidence model and the flat,
 * source-agnostic queue. Triage keeps reasoning in its own terms — corroboration across
 * model lineages, cost tiers, session trails, staleness — and only what survives that
 * reasoning crosses into the queue, flattened to a priority and a body a dev agent can
 * act on without knowing anything about playtesting.
 *
 * Only ACTIONABLE tickets cross. An `accumulating` ticket is real, kept, and readable in
 * `qa/tickets/`, but it is not yet work, and putting it in the dev loop's queue would
 * hand the loop a pile of single-report opinions to chase. The queue is for things
 * somebody should build; the ticket bucket is the whole picture.
 *
 * The submission's identity key is the TICKET id, which is itself content-addressed on
 * the problem's stable identity. So a finding that keeps recurring across cohorts
 * updates one queue item and one tracker issue for its entire life, rather than filing a
 * fresh one every wave — which is the single most important property for a queue fed by
 * a loop that runs continuously.
