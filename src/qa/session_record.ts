/**
 * The playtest session record — one immutable document per playthrough.
 *
 * The rule this module exists to enforce is simple and absolute: EVERY playthrough is
 * documented and kept. Not just the clean ones, not just the ones that reached an
 * ending, not just the ones whose isolation the runner could prove. A player who
 * crashed out at turn 6, a desktop session a human drove by hand, a run that produced
 * a malformed interview — all of them get a record. Discarding the messy ones is how a
 * QA corpus quietly becomes a survivorship-biased advertisement for itself.
 *
 * That rule is in tension with the project's other rule — that unverifiable evidence
 * must never be laundered into retention metrics — and the resolution is the same one
 * real QA organizations use: KEEP EVERYTHING, LABEL EVERYTHING, and let the consumer
 * decide what it is entitled to conclude. So a record carries its provider's isolation
 * class and its own outcome verbatim, and downstream code filters on those rather than
 * on the record's existence.
 *
 * A record is content-addressed: `record_id` is the SHA-256 of the canonical record
 * minus the id itself. Two loops writing concurrently from different machines can
 * therefore never collide (identical content is the same file; different content is a
 * different file), which is what lets the playtest fleet be mass-parallel without a
 * lock, a queue, or a coordinating service.
