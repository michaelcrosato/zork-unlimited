/**
 * Reading and writing the QA bucket (`qa/tickets/`).
 *
 * Unlike the session corpus, tickets ARE tracked in git. That is deliberate: the bucket
 * is the dev loop's inbox, the dev loop runs against a checkout, and a ticket that only
 * exists on the QA machine is a ticket the dev loop cannot act on. Keeping them in the
 * repo also means a ticket's whole life — filed, worked, fixed — is visible in history
 * next to the commits that closed it.
 *
 * One ticket per file, named by severity and id, so a plain `ls` is already a triaged
 * queue and two people editing different tickets never conflict.

/**
 * Write the bucket, replacing it wholesale.
 *
 * Safe to do because a ticket's id is derived from its stable identity, so rewriting
 * regenerates the same filenames for the same problems. Files for tickets no longer
 * present are removed — but note that triage carries unmatched prior tickets forward
 * precisely so this removal only ever drops something a caller deliberately dropped.
 *
 * That carry-forward only protects tickets the caller could READ. A file that no longer
 * parses — a schema bump, a hand-edit, a partial write — never reaches `readTickets`'s
 * ticket list, so it is never carried forward, so the cleanup below used to delete it:
 * a maintainer's `wont_fix` and notes vanished on the next `qa:triage`, silently, and
 * the only record that the ticket had ever existed was git history. A file we cannot
 * parse is exactly the file we cannot know we are done with, so it is left alone. It
 * stays visible through `readTickets().unreadable`, which every reader already reports.
