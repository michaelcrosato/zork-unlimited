/**
 * QA tickets — the only thing the dev loop reads from the playtest side.
 *
 * This is the seam that lets the two loops run at completely different speeds. The
 * playtest fleet produces a flood of raw, unequal, partly-contradictory opinion; the
 * dev loop needs a short ordered list of things worth building. A ticket is the
 * boundary object between those, and it is modelled on how a real QA organization
 * works rather than on how a benchmark works:
 *
 *   - A tester does not get to file a P1. They file a REPORT.
 *   - Triage decides what is a bug, what is one person's taste, and what is a
 *     duplicate of something already open.
 *   - A report becomes actionable through CORROBORATION or through REPRODUCTION —
 *     several independent testers hitting it, or one engineer confirming it.
 *   - Everything filed is kept, whether or not it is ever actioned.
 *
 * The last point is why `PromotionState` exists rather than a boolean. A report that
 * has been seen once is not rejected; it is `accumulating`, and it sits in the corpus
 * waiting to see whether anyone else ever hits it. Most never do — and that silence is
 * itself the answer, delivered for free.
 *
 * Ticket identity is deliberately content-addressed on the STABLE part only (kind,
 * location, cluster fingerprint) and not on the evidence, which grows every cohort. A
 * ticket therefore keeps its id from the first report through to the fix, which is what
 * makes "has this been seen before?" answerable without fuzzy matching.
