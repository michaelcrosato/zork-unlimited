/**
 * The intake queue on disk — one JSON file per submission, tracked in git.
 *
 * Tracked, not gitignored, and that is the point: the dev loop runs against a checkout,
 * so a submission that only exists on the machine that filed it is a submission the dev
 * loop cannot act on. Keeping the queue in the repo also puts a request's whole life —
 * filed, worked, done — next to the commits that closed it, which no external tracker
 * can do.
 *
 * The external tracker (GitHub Issues, see `github.ts`) is a MIRROR of this, not the
 * other way round. That ordering is deliberate: the loop must keep working when the
 * network is down, when a token expires, when someone runs it offline. A queue whose
 * canonical copy lives behind an API is a loop with an outage dependency.
 *
 * Upsert semantics rather than wholesale rewrite: submissions arrive from several
 * independent sources that know nothing about each other, so a writer must be able to
 * add its own without stepping on anyone else's.

/**
 * Add or update one submission, preserving fields the queue owns rather than the caller.
 *
 * `status` and `external` belong to the QUEUE's lifecycle — whoever is working the item,
 * and wherever it is mirrored — not to the source that keeps re-filing it. A playtest
 * loop re-triaging every wave must not reset an item a dev agent already marked
 * `in_progress`, or drop the issue number it was synced to. `created_at` is likewise
 * first-filing, not latest-filing.
 *
 * A re-file that changes nothing is a NO-OP, down to the bytes on disk. These files are
 * tracked, and `loop.sh` runs `qa:triage` (which upserts every actionable ticket) inside
 * the dev cycle AFTER the cycle-start cleanliness check — so an unconditional
 * `updated_at` bump manufactured a tracked-file diff out of an unchanged corpus and left
 * every cycle with a dirty tree it never intended to produce. "Re-filing is safe and
 * expected" (docs/two_loop_workflow.md) has to mean byte-identical when nothing moved.
 *
 * `external` is the one lifecycle field a caller MAY supply: `intake:sync` calls this
 * immediately after creating an issue, precisely to record where it landed. Keeping
 * `existing.external` unconditionally discarded that every time, so the number was never
 * stored and each sync re-searched by marker instead of being the no-op it claims to be.
