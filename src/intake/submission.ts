/**
 * A submission — one piece of work somebody wants done, whoever "somebody" is.
 *
 * This is the repository's single intake format, and its whole reason for existing is
 * that PLAYTEST FEEDBACK IS NOT THE ONLY WAY THE GAME CHANGES. An independent audit
 * agent finds a structural problem. A research agent proposes a mechanic. A human types
 * a feature request from their phone. The deterministic crawler files a softlock. None
 * of those are playtest reports, and a dev loop that could only consume playtest
 * findings would be blind to all of them.
 *
 * So the queue is deliberately source-agnostic. `src/qa/ticket.ts` stays the RICH,
 * playtest-specific evidence model — corroboration across model lineages, cost tiers,
 * session trails — because that reasoning is real and domain-specific. What lands in
 * the queue is the flattened result: a submission with a priority, a body, and a pointer
 * back to whatever evidence produced it. Other sources produce submissions directly,
 * with far simpler evidence, and compete on the same ranking.
 *
 * Identity is content-addressed on the STABLE part only — source, kind and an identity
 * key — never on the body, which gets edited, or the evidence, which accumulates. A
 * submission therefore keeps its id from first filing through to done, which is what
 * makes "have we already got this one?" answerable without fuzzy matching, and what
 * makes syncing to an external tracker idempotent instead of duplicate-generating.
