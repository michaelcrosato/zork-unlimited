/**
 * Playtest provider registry — the model-agnostic seam.
 *
 * Before this module the live blind harness was hard-wired to one vendor: the
 * runner rejected anything but `--provider codex`, and the transport profile was a
 * switch on an exact model string. That made "add another vendor" a code change in
 * five files, so in practice the fleet was homogeneous — which is the worst possible
 * shape for the evidence it produces (see `familyDiversity` in ../feedback/rank.ts:
 * forty runs of ONE model agreeing is one instrument sampled forty times, not forty
 * independent witnesses).
 *
 * The registry separates three things that were previously fused:
 *
 *   1. HOW a client is launched          — `kind` + `launch`
 *   2. HOW ITS BLINDNESS IS ESTABLISHED  — `kind` + `capture`, from which `isolation`
 *                                          is DERIVED (see `derivePlaytestIsolation`)
 *   3. WHICH MODELS it may play as       — an operator-owned catalog
 *
 * (3) is deliberately data, not code. Exact model ids churn constantly and differ by
 * subscription tier, so pinning them in TypeScript guarantees the file is stale. The
 * catalogs under `blind-tester/catalogs/` are operator-editable and validated by the
 * same schema the registry uses, so adding a model your subscription just unlocked is
 * a JSON edit, and adding a whole vendor is one registry entry plus one catalog.
 *
 * `isolation` is the field that keeps this honest, and it is NOT a formality. The
 * project's rule has always been that unverifiable evidence must never be laundered
 * into retention metrics (docs/blind_playtest_protocol.md). A headless CLI the runner
 * spawns can have its tool surface PROVEN — the runner owns the argv, the cwd, and the
 * tool allowlist, so `runner_enforced` blindness is a fact about the process. A desktop
 * client a human wired to the MCP server cannot be proven by any code in this repo;
 * only the operator can assert it. Both are useful and BOTH ARE KEPT — nothing a
 * playtester produces is ever discarded — but they are different evidence classes and
 * the QA pipeline must be able to tell them apart. Collapsing them would reintroduce
 * exactly the contamination the `BLIND_AGENT_CMD` ban exists to prevent.
 *
 * Which is why `isolation` is no longer something an author gets to ASSERT. It used to
 * be a hand-written literal whose only protection was the comment below it and a
 * reviewer noticing — and the failure it warns about (a vendor stamped
 * `runner_enforced` that the runner cannot actually witness) is silent, permanent and
 * downstream: the recorder copies the label verbatim into a sealed corpus record and
 * the QA pipeline then lets hand-played sessions move experience metrics. So the label
 * is now COMPUTED from facts a lie cannot survive: the provider's `kind`, whether it
 * declares a complete `capture` block, and whether that block's named reader module is
 * actually present in this checkout. `derivePlaytestIsolation` is the only authority;
 * the stored field is kept as a redundant, human-readable copy that MUST agree with the
 * derivation or the registry refuses to parse. Adding a vendor is therefore a registry
 * entry, a catalog, a capture block and a reader module — and the strongest evidence
 * label in the system arrives only when the last of those exists on disk.
