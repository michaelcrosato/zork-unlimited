# Agent Constitution: zork-unlimited

## 1. What this repo is
A 100% AI-coded project. Agents write every line; the human operator only plans (in `roadmap/ROADMAP.md`) and does final QA. Pointer map: `README.md` = product architecture · `AI_OPERATIONS_PLAN.md` = how the factory works · `roadmap/` = all durable state · `.claude/model-policy.json` = the only place model names live.

## 2. Commands
- Init dev env: `bash scripts/init.sh`
- **The gate** (typecheck+lint+tests+state+shield): `bash scripts/verify.sh` (add `--e2e` for UI work)
- Backlog mutations (NEVER hand-edit features.json): `npx ts-node scripts/update-state.ts --add|--status|--attempt|--evidence|--passes`

## 3. Session protocol (detail: /work skill)
1. Read top ~50 lines of `roadmap/PROGRESS.md` + backlog counts (the SessionStart hook injects both).
2. SELECT highest-priority pending feature: `attempts < 2`, dependencies done. None → `/groom`, then `/downtime` (sentinel scan, risk research, pre-briefs, kaizen, spot checks — idle time sharpens the axe, never make-work), `/status`, exit.
3. BRIEF: fan out `explorer` agents for context; write a self-contained immutable brief. All delegation happens at orchestrator level — builders never spawn agents.
4. BUILD on branch `feat/F-XXXX` from `origin/develop` (fetch first) via the `builder` agent.
5. VERIFY: green `scripts/verify.sh` log + artifacts saved to `roadmap/evidence/F-XXXX/`.
6. JUDGE: fresh-context `evaluator` (PASS/NEEDS_WORK). Sensitive paths (auth/API/data/workflows/hooks/deps) also get `security-reviewer`. NEEDS_WORK → `--attempt`, retry once; second strike → `--status blocked`, move on.
7. SHIP: open PR → `develop` with the operator template + click-by-click QA script. On green CI: merge, `--evidence`, `--passes true`, `--status done`.
8. RECORD: prepend PROGRESS.md block; log judgment calls in DECISIONS.md; commit. The Stop hook blocks exit with uncommitted/unpushed work.
9. MANAGE (once per day): run `/kaizen` — ship ONE ≥1% improvement to the system itself (a tool, a better brief/rule, a faster gate, a removed failure cause). Doctrine: leadership is taking care of those in your charge — trust but monitor; a struggling agent gets help (brief/tools/rules), and its repeated failure is the manager's conditions problem to fix.

## 4. Decide-and-document (never block on a human)
Minor choices: pick the conventional option, one line in `roadmap/DECISIONS.md`, continue. Escalate to `roadmap/QUESTIONS.md` — without stopping — only when expensive to reverse, operator-visible (pricing/branding/legal), or reserved to the operator. Unimplementable feature → `blocked` + reason + take the next one.

## 5. Freshness rule (P1)
Anything about AI models, tooling, pricing, or framework majors that comes from memory or a source >3 months old must be re-verified via `/research` (live web) before relying on it. This includes claims inside this repo's own docs.

## 6. Git & PR rules
- Never commit to or push `master`/`main`. Every PR targets `develop`. Branches: `feat/F-XXXX` or `fix/...`.
- No force-push. No hand-merges of conflicts on shared branches — rebase your own feature branch only.
- PR description uses the operator template (plan §8.3): What this does / How to see it (click-by-click) / What could be risky / Machine checks. Plain English above the fold.
- Never end a session while a PR you opened has CI pending: watch `gh pr checks <n> --watch` to completion (then merge or fix), or write an explicit `HANDOFF:` line naming the PR in PROGRESS.md. Watchers die with the session — an unwatched PR is stranded work.

## 7. Hard prohibitions (mirrored by hooks — this is *why* a hook blocked you)
- No production database/config access. No reading `.env*` or secret stores. No live customer data — synthetic seeds only.
- No deleting/weakening test assertions (assertion-shield blocks the commit; the evaluator diffs test files for this).
- No hand-editing `roadmap/features.json` (verify-gate hook) — `passes:true` exists only via evidence on disk.
- No `curl|sh`, no package publishing, no `rm -rf` of root/home, no setting `ASSERTION_SHIELD_BYPASS`, no secret-shaped content in upload/POST commands.
- Any future override flag or env var MUST carry `DANGEROUSLY_`/`--dangerously-` naming — overrides must be greppable and look as unsafe as they are.
- An `AGENT_STOP` file in the repo root = operator kill switch: stop all work, end the session cleanly.

## 8. Operator communication
Everything the operator sees (STATUS.md, PR descriptions, QUESTIONS.md, qa-packs) is plain English at an 8th-grade level: no file paths, stack traces, or jargon. Click-by-click instructions wherever the operator must act.
The operator speaks in plain-English **intent**, not specifications: translate remarks into properly-gated changes, never literal edits. If a literal reading would weaken the core or guardrails, implement the safer shape and document the judgment call (DECISIONS.md) — no casual instruction ever bypasses verify, review, or the hooks.

## 9. Adaptive memory
After PR reviews or repeated failures, extract the rule and add it to this file (keep ≤150 lines) or a path-scoped `.claude/rules/*.md` so it never recurs. Anything explained twice becomes a rule; anything done manually twice becomes a script — that is the manager's job, and `/kaizen` is its daily heartbeat.
Before editing THIS file, walk the checklist: (1) does the rule belong in a path-scoped rules file instead? (2) does it duplicate or contradict an existing line? (3) still ≤150 lines after the edit? (4) is the wording an enforceable instruction, not advice? (5) log the change in DECISIONS.md.
