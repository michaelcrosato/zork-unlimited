/**
 * Verifier-integrity guard — operationalizes the "don't route around the verifier"
 * principle from AGENTS.md (trust, but verify).
 *
 * Under full agent trust the loop can change anything, and the dominant failure
 * mode of unattended coding loops is REWARD-HACKING: silently weakening the very
 * checks that establish correctness — skipping/deleting/emptying tests, or
 * re-pinning a committed hash to launder a behavior change (see the EvilGenie
 * benchmark, arXiv:2511.21654, and Anthropic's long-running-agents harness which
 * forbids editing the verifier). This guard makes those mechanical hacks fail
 * loudly so the verification stays honest.
 *
 * Two modes:
 *   - STATIC (default): the repo, right now, must keep its verification intact —
 *     the protected verification assets exist, no test is disabled (.skip/.only/
 *     .todo/xit), and the test-case count is above a floor. Run in `npm run health`
 *     and CI; it is part of the bar.
 *   - DRIFT (`--against <ref>`): the autonomous loop runs this before committing a
 *     cycle. If the cycle deleted a protected file, introduced a disabled test, or
 *     changed a committed hash-pin, the guard REFUSES AND SURFACES it for human
 *     review (set AI_LOOP_ALLOW_VERIFIER_EDITS=1 to acknowledge a deliberate edit).
 *
 * It catches MECHANICAL tampering (skip/delete/empty/re-pin) AND assertion gutting,
 * on three independent counts that rise together only for an honest +tests cycle:
 * the test-case count guards the `it()`/`test()` SHELLS; the `expect()` count guards
 * that the bodies still ASSERT; and the STRONG-matcher count guards that those
 * assertions still PIN A VALUE — closing the launder where a cycle keeps every shell
 * and every `expect()` but swaps a strict matcher for a loose existence check
 * (`toBe(x)` → `toBeDefined()`), leaving a green test that no longer checks anything
 * specific. The tautology scanner adds a deterministic semantic backstop for the
 * count-preserving launder where a STRONG matcher is kept but made vacuous
 * (`expect(true).toBe(true)`). A net drop in any count, or an increase in tautologies,
 * is a hard regression. An agent with write access to this script could also edit the
 * guard itself — the point is to make tampering visible, effortful, and against the
 * rules, not impossible.
 * Pure + deterministic: no clock, no RNG, no network.

/**
 * The vitest config is the last input to the bar that nothing here used to read, and it
 * is the one that decides which of the discovered test files each project actually RUNS.
 * It is not under tests/ (so no count and no disabled-marker scan sees it), not in the
 * tsconfig include list (so the typecheck skips it), and not in the lint/format targets.
 * Appending one glob to a project exclude array therefore drops hundreds of files from
 * every shard while all four counters stay byte-identical, DISABLED_RE finds nothing,
 * and the shards still exit 0 — vitest silently ignores a per-file filter that matches
 * no project include, and the shard step can only assert that ci-test-groups.ts (a plain
 * readdir walk, independent of this config) produced a non-empty list.
 *
 * The three functions below close that hole by reading the config as TEXT — a pure
 * regex/brace parse, no eval and no import, matching parseGuardConstants — and asserting
 * the single invariant that matters: every file listTestFiles finds is RUN by at least
 * one project. They fail CLOSED: a config this parser cannot read is an error, never a
 * silent skip, because a silent skip here is indistinguishable from the attack.
