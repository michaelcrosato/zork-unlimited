# loop-stop.sh — RELIABLY stop THIS project's AFK loop, and ONLY this project's.
#
# Project-scoped pid files are necessary but not sufficient: a stale pid can be
# reused by an unrelated process. loop.sh therefore records `pid start_ticks`, where
# start_ticks is /proc/<pid>/stat field 22. This script validates BOTH before it
# enumerates descendants and again immediately before every signal. Descendants get
# their current start tick snapshotted too, closing the enumerate-then-reuse race.
#
# A dead stale record is safe to remove. A live malformed, mismatched, or
# unverifiable record is not safe to act on: stop fails closed and preserves the
# files for inspection. No global process-name search is ever used.
#
# NOTE: also TaskStop the harness background task that launched ./loop.sh (not from bash).
# Usage:  bash scripts/loop-stop.sh [--dry-run]
