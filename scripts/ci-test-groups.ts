/**
 * File-level body-time samples from successful GitHub Actions run 30295854622
 * (2026-07-27). The raw Vitest shard split put most of these census proofs in
 * one job. Keep only the material outliers here; ordinary and future files use
 * the measured residual-file baseline below and are still discovered at run
 * time.
 *
 * A sample is only an outlier for as long as the file it names still does the work
 * that was measured. This table is a frozen one-shot snapshot with nothing that
 * re-measures it, so an entry can outlive its file: the two ending-render proofs sat
 * here at ~272s and ~271s each long after 303dc6b6 (2026-08-01) rewrote both into
 * 28-line fast companion guards that now run in 1.2s of test body time TOGETHER. That
 * was 543s of phantom cost in a 6,823s table — 8% — inflating the reported per-shard
 * estimate from roughly 63 to 67.9 minutes, and the two entries only kept the split
 * balanced because they happened to land one per shard. They are re-pinned below at
 * the residual-file baseline: with the expensive traversal gone they are ordinary
 * files, and that baseline is this table's own CI-measured price for an ordinary file.
 * When rewriting a listed file, re-measure or re-baseline its entry in the same change —
 * the dangerous direction is the reverse of this one, since a file that grows expensive
 * carries no entry at all and is packed as if trivial.
