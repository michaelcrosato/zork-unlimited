/**
 * One command for the whole landing loop: test, commit, push, PR, merge, delete.
 *
 *   npm run ship -- "what you changed"
 *
 * The point is that `main` is the only branch that survives. Each ship is a short-lived
 * branch that exists just long enough to carry a PR, and the PR is squash-merged so main
 * gains exactly ONE commit per ship. That is what makes rollback cheap: every landing is
 * a single revertable commit with a PR next to it explaining itself. A workflow nobody
 * runs protects nothing, so this is deliberately one line to type.
 *
 * WHICH BAR IT RUNS IS NOT A FLAG. It is read off the diff. The census proofs
 * (`test:exhaustive`) import only the scopes in CENSUS_PROOF_SOURCE_SCOPES, so a change
 * outside them cannot move a census verdict and the fast lane is sufficient evidence. A
 * change INSIDE them gets the full bar automatically, because there the proofs ARE the
 * ground truth. Choosing correctly by hand every time is exactly the thing people stop
 * doing at 2am, so the script does it and prints why.
 *
 * Nothing is pushed until the bar is green. A red bar exits nonzero with the work still
 * in the tree, uncommitted and unpushed.
 *
 * Flags:
 *   --full        force the full bar even when the diff does not require it
 *   --no-merge    open/update the PR and stop; do not merge or delete the branch
 *   --dry-run     print the plan and the chosen bar, touch nothing
