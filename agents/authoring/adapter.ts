/**
 * Adapter agent (spec §12.2, §12.3).
 *
 * Input: a writer story + the engine contract. Output: a schema-valid content pack
 * plus a per-beat classification (§11). The adapter loops against the deterministic
 * validator (§12.3) — feeding each round's ERROR findings back into the prompt —
 * until the pack is green or a round budget is hit. This is the "iterate until the
 * report is green" loop from §10, with the validator (not the model) deciding
 * correctness (§16). Provider-agnostic; deterministic under MockAuthorProvider.
 *
 * The adapter emits exactly one runtime shape: RPG. It loops against `validateRpg`
 * (the richest validator: room graph, objects, quests, combat, skill checks, and
 * ending reachability) until the pack is green or the round budget is hit.
