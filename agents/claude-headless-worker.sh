# Headless `claude` worker launcher for loop.sh (AI_AGENT_CMD=agents/claude-headless-worker.sh).
# Satisfies the dev-agents.json contract: reads the cycle prompt from STDIN, edits files in
# $PWD, runs non-interactively, exits nonzero on failure. Compared with the registry's bare
# `claude -p` it adds what an unattended run turned out to need:
#   - an explicit tool allowlist instead of a blanket permission bypass, and the scheduling /
#     subagent / messaging tool families disallowed outright (a one-turn worker has no use
#     for them, and they were the source of every "ended its turn expecting a wake-up" loss)
#   - a minimal environment (env -i) so nothing leaks in from the operator's own session
#   - a fresh session id with no persistence, so the worker never writes into anyone else's
#     transcript and the CLI's session registry cannot kill a finished run at the last step
#   - a per-run spend cap, a streamed JSON record under ai-runs/dev-agent/, and a one-line
#     cost/turn summary on stdout for the cycle log
#   - the whole agent process group is stopped on TERM (the driver's timeout path), so a
#     stuck worker cannot keep editing the checkout after the cycle was recorded as failed
# Knobs (env, all optional): DEV_AGENT_MODEL (default claude-sonnet-5), DEV_AGENT_EFFORT
# (default max), DEV_AGENT_MAX_BUDGET_USD (default 25), DEV_AGENT_CONTROL_FILE (a file of
# KEY=value lines re-read at every launch, so an operator can retune between cycles
# without restarting loop.sh), DEV_AGENT_RUN_DIR (default ai-runs/dev-agent).

# HEADLESS CONTRACT. A `claude -p` run is ONE non-interactive turn: when the model ends its
# turn the process exits and nothing resumes it. Cycle 2026-09-05T22-57-25 was lost exactly
# this way — the worker backgrounded its test run, "ended its turn" expecting a wake-up, and
# the loop found no provisional commit. CLAUDE_AUTO_BACKGROUND_TASKS is inherited from the
# orchestrator's environment and makes long commands go to the background automatically, so
# it is dropped here, and the appended system prompt states the contract outright.
HEADLESS_CONTRACT="EXECUTION CONTRACT FOR THIS RUN: you are a single non-interactive turn inside an automated dev-loop cycle (loop.sh). Nothing resumes you after you stop: there are no wake-ups, no scheduled follow-ups, and no notifications, and ending your turn with work unfinished FAILS the cycle and reverts everything you did. Therefore: never run commands in the background (never set run_in_background; wait for every command in the foreground, using a long timeout when a check is slow), never schedule anything, never say you will continue later. Do not stop until the cycle prompt's deliverables exist on disk — in commit mode that means the provisional commit is made and \`git status --porcelain\` is empty apart from the ledger file the prompt tells you to leave. Stay inside this repository checkout. CHECKS: run only FOCUSED checks — the specific test files for what you touched plus lint and format on those files; do NOT run npm run health, npm run health:fast, npm test, or the whole vitest suite yourself. The driver runs the correct bar after your provisional commit (and a red bar reverts the cycle), so a whole-suite run inside your turn only burns your time budget; the last worker ran the fast bar three times and nearly timed out."
# NO SESSION PERSISTENCE + STREAMED OUTPUT (v4). Cycles 2026-09-05T23-14-29 and 23-53-04 both
# finished their work and committed, then the CLI printed "Session ID <id> is already in use"
# and exited 1 without its result JSON. Subagent use did not separate survivors from victims,
# so the session registry is taken out of the picture: workers keep no persisted session
# (nothing to be "in use"), and the stream is written incrementally so a crash at the very
# end can no longer erase the cost/turn record or the worker's final report.
# MINIMAL ENVIRONMENT. Cycle 2026-09-05T23-14-29 died at the very end with "Session ID ... is
# already in use" right after the worker used the subagent tool twice; the orchestrator's
# remote-session environment (messaging socket, session ingress, scheduling backends,
# auto-background, autocompact override) had leaked into every worker. Verified: the CLI
# authenticates with only PATH/HOME, the proxy + CA settings, ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL and the
# host-provider marker. The loop's own AI_* knobs pass through so claim identity is the lane's.
