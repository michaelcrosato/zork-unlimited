/**
 * Fixer agent (spec §12.5, §15, §16).
 *
 * The fixer proposes a STRUCTURED, single-layer patch (a `ContentPatchProposal`)
 * and our deterministic code applies it — the model never edits files, runs
 * shell, or writes code (§16). Each op is drawn from a CLOSED whitelist; an op
 * outside it is refused. After applying, the pack is re-parsed through its Zod
 * schema and re-validated, so a "fix" that breaks the contract is rejected rather
 * than silently shipped (§10). This is the safe analogue of a model "editing the
 * game": data in, validated data out.
 *
 * The fixer touches exactly one of {content, engine_rule, validator, test,
 * hint_text, quest_structure}. Content/hint/quest patches are expressed as the
 * whitelisted ops below and applied deterministically. engine_rule/validator/test
 * changes fall OUTSIDE this structured-patch vocabulary: the fixer surfaces them as
 * a diagnosis and the agent makes those code edits directly under trust, but verify
 * (AGENTS.md — full authority, no human-approval gate, no §14 ceremony), with the
 * automated verification (`npm run health`) as the bar. Keeping the model on the
 * data-in/validated-data-out path is the §16 safety property; it is no longer a
 * human-approval gate.
