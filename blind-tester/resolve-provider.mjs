/**
 * Resolve one provider + model against the registry, for shell callers.
 *
 * Plain ESM with no dependencies, deliberately. `run.sh` has to resolve a provider
 * before it can launch anything, and it runs in places with no TypeScript loader and
 * no installed dev dependencies — a bare temp clone in a test, a fresh machine, a
 * sandbox with no network. A `tsx` invocation here fails in exactly those places, and
 * the failure looks like "your provider is invalid" rather than "the toolchain is
 * missing", which is the worst possible error to debug.
 *
 * The typed module (src/blind/providers.ts) parses the SAME JSON file, so there is one
 * source of truth and nothing to keep in sync. Validation here is intentionally thin —
 * enough to give the shell an actionable message — because the typed module and its
 * tests own the full schema.
 *
 * ISOLATION IS DERIVED HERE, NOT COPIED. See `deriveProviderIsolation` below: the one
 * thing this file must never do is hand `run.sh` a `runner_enforced` label it did not
 * check, because that label is what decides whether a session counts as evidence.
 *
 * Output formats — one resolution, three renderings, so they cannot drift:
 *
 *   (default)   kind<TAB>isolation<TAB>model<TAB>tier, one line.
 *               The ORIGINAL contract, kept byte-compatible on purpose: `run.sh` used
 *               to cut those exact fields and `playtest-loop.sh` still cuts field 3.
 *   --records   key<TAB>value lines, repeated keys for list-valued fields. This is what
 *               `run.sh` consumes: columns cannot carry an argv array, and Bash has no
 *               JSON parser, so a JSON mode would only force a second Node process whose
 *               absence is the entire reason this file exists. Values are guaranteed
 *               free of tabs and newlines (enforced below), so `IFS=$'\t' read -r k v`
 *               is exact rather than best-effort. Absent fields are OMITTED rather than
 *               emitted empty, so a shell reader keeps its own initialized default.
 *   --json      one JSON document, for callers that have a parser (tests, tooling, and
 *               any future non-Bash launcher).
 *
 * Exits 2 with a human-readable reason on failure; the caller surfaces it verbatim.

 * Compute a provider's evidence class, and say why.

 * exists only because the authority is TypeScript and this file must answer on a
 * machine with no TypeScript loader (see the header) — a shell path that cannot resolve
 * a provider without `tsx` is a shell path that dies on the machines the harness most
 * needs to work on.
 *
 * Two things keep a mirror from becoming a second opinion:
 *
 *   1. tests/regression/blind_provider_isolation_contract.test.ts imports BOTH and
 *      asserts they return the same isolation, code, reason and readerModule for every
 *      shipped provider and for a synthetic subject in each of the four reason classes.
 *      The reason sentences are reproduced verbatim for exactly that purpose: identical
 *      prose makes drift a test failure instead of a difference nobody notices.
 *   2. `resolveProvider` refuses outright when this derivation disagrees with the
 *      `isolation` literal stored in the registry. src/blind/providers.ts makes that
 *      disagreement a hard parse failure; a runner that shrugged it off would be the one
 *      component still willing to act on a label the type-checked path had rejected.
 *
 * The rule itself: `runner_enforced` IFF the runner spawns it (`kind === "headless_cli"`),
 * it declares a complete `capture` block, and that block's reader module exists on disk.
 * Anything else is `operator_attested` — not as a penalty, but because "a human asserts
