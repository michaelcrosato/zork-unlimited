/**
 * Claude Code session-log reader — the capture half of the `claude_code` registry entry.
 *
 * `src/blind/providers.ts` derives a provider's evidence class from three facts: the
 * runner spawns it, it declares a complete `capture` block, and that block's reader
 * module EXISTS. This is that module. Until it landed, `claude_code` derived
 * `operator_attested` — correctly, because nothing here could read a Claude Code
 * session, so every session it produced was a human's word. The point of writing it is
 * not to make a label prettier; it is to make the seam real by qualifying a SECOND
 * vendor on the same terms as the first, so "model-agnostic" stops being an aspiration
 * in a comment.
 *
 * It is far smaller than `codex-rollout.mjs`, and the reason is worth stating because it
 * is the strongest property this vendor has: Claude Code accepts `--session-id <uuid>`,
 * so the RUNNER picks the id and the log's path is fully determined BEFORE the process
 * starts. Codex announces its own thread id after the fact, which forces that reader to
 * walk a sessions tree, match an announced id against a private rollout, and defend the
 * whole walk against symlinks, renames, and a second Codex the operator happened to be
 * running. None of that exists here. One path, computed up front, read once.
 *
 * WHAT THIS MODULE PROVES, AND WHAT IT CANNOT
 *
 * Two artifacts, and they answer different questions. Confusing them is how a reader
 * ends up certifying a session it never actually constrained:
 *
 *   1. The private JSONL transcript under `<home>/.claude/projects/<cwd-slug>/<id>.jsonl`
 *      records what the model CALLED. It is written by the client itself, after the
 *      fact, and it is the only durable record of the run.
 *   2. The `system`/`init` event on the client's own stdout stream records what the model
 *      was OFFERED — the resolved tool list and the resolved MCP server set, as the
 *      client computed them from the argv the runner supplied.
 *
 * The transcript alone is NOT sufficient, and that is the single most important sentence
 * in this file. A transcript containing only AdventureForge tool calls is equally
 * consistent with "the player had nothing else" and with "the player had a shell and a
 * web fetch and simply did not reach for them this run". The first is blindness; the
 * second is an unproven habit that will break the day a model gets curious. So the init
 * event is load-bearing: it is the ONLY place the offered surface is observable, and
 * `auditClaudeInitEvent` is what turns "it did not misbehave" into "it could not".
 *
 * Both checks are closed whitelists over the same set the game server itself enforces
 * (`PURE_PLAYER_TOOLS` in `src/mcp/server.ts`, mirrored as `CODEX_PURE_PLAYER_TOOLS` in
 * `codex-pure-envelope.mjs` and imported here rather than copied). A fourth copy of that
 * list would be a fourth thing to forget to update, and the failure mode of a stale copy
 * is that a newly added authoring tool silently counts as pure.
 *
 * WHAT THIS MODULE DELIBERATELY DOES NOT DO
 *
 * It does not stamp an `isolation` value onto its receipt. The derivation in
 * `src/blind/providers.ts` is the only authority on that label, and a reader that also
 * announced one would create a second authority that could disagree with the first —
 * which is precisely the shape of failure the derivation was introduced to remove. This
 * module emits FACTS (which tools were offered, which were called, which session, which
 * directory); the registry decides what class of evidence those facts constitute.
 *
 * It also does not close the record-TYPE vocabulary the way `codex-pure-envelope.mjs`
 * closes Codex's. Claude Code writes a large and version-dependent set of bookkeeping
 * rows (`queue-operation`, `atis-latch`, `file-history-delta`, `frame-link`, `ai-title`,
 * …; sixteen distinct types in one real 2939-row log on this machine). None of them is
 * evidence about the tool boundary, so an allowlist over them would fail honest sessions
 * on a client upgrade while proving nothing. The whitelists live exactly where the
 * evidence is: the offered tools, and the called tools.

 * artifacts; this vendor needs far less because the receipt already carries the audited
 * tool boundary, so the envelope's only new job is the RESULT: exactly one successful
 * result event, bound to the same pinned session as everything else, answered by the
 * model the run was requested for. Everything the runner's telemetry reads
 * (`is_error`, `duration_ms`, `num_turns`, `total_cost_usd`, `usage`) is forwarded
 * from that event verbatim — the client's report of its own run, never a synthesis.
 *
 * Like the receipt, it emits FACTS and no isolation verdict — see the module header.
