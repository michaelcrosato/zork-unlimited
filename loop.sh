# The DEV loop driver. Usage: ./loop.sh [--once]   (protocol: docs/afk_loop.md)
#
# ANY MODEL CAN RUN THIS LOOP. The driver resolves whichever supported headless
# coding agent is installed (see DEV_AGENT_IDS below) without inspecting credential
# files; AI_AGENT names one explicitly and AI_AGENT_CMD overrides the command
# outright. No vendor is privileged, and adding one is a single table entry.
#
# This loop DOES NOT PLAY THE GAME. Blind playtesting is a separate, independently
# paced loop (playtest-loop.sh). Its corroborated findings arrive here as submissions
# in intake/queue/ — the same queue an audit agent, a research proposal, the crawler,
# or a person files into, because playtest feedback is not the only way the game
# changes. That split is the point: this loop used to spend most of its wall
# clock blocked on one blind playthrough of the exact commit under test, which
# capped throughput at roughly one change per playtest. Now the mechanical bar —
# crawl, health, verifier integrity — is the whole gate, and quality evidence
# arrives asynchronously from a fleet that never has to wait for a build.

# ── Dev-agent registry ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
# The contract an entry must satisfy — the ONLY things this loop assumes about the

#
#   1. reads its instructions from STDIN (never argv: the cycle prompt is long, and
#      argv leaks it into the process table)
#   2. can create and edit files in $PWD, and run the repo's own commands
#   3. runs to completion non-interactively, with no approval prompt
#   4. exits 0 on success and nonzero on failure — a nonzero exit fails the cycle,
#      because partial output is not evidence the requested work completed
#
# Anything meeting that contract works, whether or not it is listed here. The list
# exists so the common cases need no configuration, not to restrict the field.
#
# Flags are operator-verifiable: CLIs change, and a wrong flag here should be a
# one-line fix rather than a reason to distrust the loop. Confirm yours once with
# `AI_AGENT=<id> AI_LOOP_MAX_CYCLES=1 ./loop.sh`.
