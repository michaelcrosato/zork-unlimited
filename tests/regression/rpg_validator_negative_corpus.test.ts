/**
 * bug_0182 — a SoundnessBench-style NEGATIVE CORPUS for `validateRpg`: a set of
 * deliberately-UNSOUND RPG packs the Stage-4 validator MUST REJECT, each pinning ONE
 * previously-untested error branch in the REJECTION direction.
 *
 * This is the generator/validator-boundary twin of bug_0181's load-boundary rejection
 * gate. The motivating gap (SoundnessBench, arXiv:2412.03154; the single-checker blind
 * spot, arXiv:2510.14253 / [[verifier-assertion-guard]]): a checker is only proven
 * sound if its FAILING branches are exercised on input that SHOULD fail. An audit of
 * the suite (bug_0182) found `validateRpg` emits ten error codes, but SIX had NO
 * rejection-direction witness anywhere in the test suite — only COMBAT_UNWINNABLE,
 * COMBAT_NOT_GUARANTEED, COMBAT_GAUNTLET_NOT_GUARANTEED and ENEMY_DEATH_ENDING_UNDECLARED
 * were pinned red-going. So a regression that silently broke any of the six (a dropped
 * `findings.push`, an inverted guard, a `??` default that swallows the case) would pass
 * every existing test GREEN — the present-but-untested-checker surface.
 *
 * The six this corpus opened with:
 *   - MISSING_STAT            — meta.vars_init lacks a required HP/attack/defense stat
 *   - BAD_HP                  — starting HP is not positive
 *   - ENEMY_ROOM_MISSING      — an enemy stands in a room that does not exist
 *   - ENEMY_DEATH_NOT_DEATH   — an enemy's death_ending names a NON-death ending
 *   - SKILL_CHECK_IMPOSSIBLE  — a check whose difficulty exceeds d20 + best skill
 *   - END_GAME_UNDECLARED     — an RPG-only branch (on_defeat) ends at an undeclared ending
 *
 * Then the same blind spot re-opened, exactly as the foundation corpus predicted it
 * would. `validateRpg` grew from those ten codes to 33 while this list stayed a
 * hand-written six, and a later audit found MANEUVER_SEQUENCE_ENEMY_GATE_VOLATILE and
 * MANEUVER_SEQUENCE_HP_CONDITION appearing NOWHERE in the repository outside their
 * three emit sites — invert either guard and every test stayed green. The fix the
 * foundation corpus already carries was never brought across: derive the required code
 * set BY SCANNING THE VALIDATOR SOURCE, so a code that gains an emit site fails this
 * suite until it is either fixtured here or consciously allowlisted with a witness
 * elsewhere. The coverage pin below does that, and the two orphaned maneuver-sequence
 * codes are fixtured as cases seven and eight:
 *   - MANEUVER_SEQUENCE_ENEMY_GATE_VOLATILE — an active-state condition on a sequenced
 *     enemy reads one of its own maneuver result flags, so committing an opening could
 *     make the live foe vanish between beats
 *   - MANEUVER_SEQUENCE_HP_CONDITION        — a sequenced enemy (or one of its
 *     maneuvers) gates on combat HP, which changes between beats and cannot be treated
 *     as an encounter constant
 *
 * Method (the bug_0118/0179 copy-mutate discipline): the GREEN base is the canonical
 * sound pack `generateRpgPack(0)` — it validates clean and carries every structure the
 * defects need (two enemies with on_defeat, a `might` skill_check, vars_init stats, a
 * declared non-death ending). Each case structuredClone()s it and introduces EXACTLY
 * ONE defect, so the rejection is attributable to that mutation alone. The differential
 * anchor (`the green base is clean and carries none of these codes`) proves the code is
 * absent until the mutation introduces it — never a code the base already raised.
 *
 * PURELY ADDITIVE: a new regression test + a bug artifact. No source/validator/engine/
 * schema/generator/corpus/protected-file change, no hash re-pin — the validator is
 * exercised exactly as shipped.
