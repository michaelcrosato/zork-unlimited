/**
 * bug_0049 — the canonical blind-playtest protocol stops instructing the RETIRED
 * §14 human-approval ceremony as live policy.
 *
 * Backstory: the project switched to "trust, but verify" — the agent has full
 * authority over ALL game code (engine, validators, schemas), gated by nothing but
 * the automated verification (AGENTS.md: "no human-approval gate and no §14
 * ceremony"). But docs/blind_playtest_protocol.md — the canonical protocol the AFK
 * loop runs EVERY cycle and wires into the agent prompt (src/ai-loop.ts) — still
 * carried the pre-charter triage rule: "engine_rule / validator / schema → gated
 * (§14): propose only; a human reviews. Do not silently change engine rules in an
 * AFK cycle." A fresh agent following it would refuse the very engine/validator
 * fixes the charter grants — the concrete form of the long-logged bug_0045
 * deferred[a] lever (docs citing a RETIRED CONCEPT, the §14 ceremony).
 *
 * This locks the fix with a conservative, deterministic guard: it flags only the
 * phrases that instruct the gate as LIVE policy, and must stay silent on the
 * legitimate NEGATIONS the charter docs use ("no §14 ceremony", "no human-approval
 * gate") and on history/spec docs that merely RECORD the retired ceremony. We check
 * only the docs a fresh agent actually follows as current process.
