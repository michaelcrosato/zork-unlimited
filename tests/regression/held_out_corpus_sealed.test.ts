/**
 * bug_0163 — the held-out generator corpus is sealed, deterministic, and still clears the bar.
 *
 * The procedural RPG generator mints fresh, validator-clean packs the assessor checks every cycle
 * — but those windows were minted-and-DISCARDED in memory. bin/
 * seal-corpus.ts persists a FIXED seed window as a committed, content-hash-sealed artifact under
 * the top-level `corpus/` dir (NEVER under content/rpg/pack, so it adds no blind-playtest
 * obligation and keeps all_packs_validated_by_bar.test.ts's discovery on curated packs). This is
 * the contamination-control substrate the benchmark thesis requires: a
 * sealed, timestamped, held-out split (docs/CURRENT_PLAN.md "HELD-OUT CORPUS PERSISTENCE";
 * docs/ULTRAPLAN-2026-06-02.md).
 *
 * This guard is the STANDING re-mint-and-verify check that keeps the corpus honest. Mirroring
 * all_packs_validated_by_bar.test.ts's discovery/zero-error pattern, for EVERY corpus/manifest.json
 * entry it asserts ALL of:
 *   1. RE-MINT DETERMINISM — re-minting from the recorded seed via the same generator reproduces
 *      the recorded content_hash byte-for-byte (no wall-clock; the hashState seal IS the proof).
 *   2. GENERATOR VERSION MATCH — entry.generator_version equals the live RPG_GENERATOR_VERSION,
 *      so a generator bump that forgets a re-seal is a loud, diagnosable "generator changed".
 *   3. YAML ROUND-TRIP STABILITY — the committed corpus/<mode>/<pack_id>.yaml parses and re-hashes
 *      to the recorded content_hash (the on-disk YAML is byte-faithful to the minted pack).
 *   4. PRODUCTION-BAR CLEAN — validateRpg on the re-mint returns ZERO findings (the
 *      corpus clears the SAME bar the curated packs do — this STRENGTHENS, never weakens).
 *   5. MANIFEST COUNT — the entry count equals the seeded window size (no silent drop/add).
 *
 * A generator change that shifts an emitted pack, a tampered corpus file, a dropped/added entry,
 * or a forgotten re-seal all fail loudly here. Re-seal with `npm run corpus:seal`.
