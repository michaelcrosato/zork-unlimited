/**
 * Trace-load integrity gate — the REJECTION-DIRECTION oracle for the trace
 * boundary (bug_0190), extending the §16 load-integrity arc (bug_0181–0184) from
 * the SAVE load to the TRACE load.
 *
 * `replay_trace` / `inspect_trace` each `JSON.parse(readFileSync(trace_path))` an
 * UNTRUSTED on-disk trace and feed `trace.initial_state` straight into the engine
 * (replay.ts:45 runActions; inspect's own per-step loop + diagnose). The
 * content-hash check on each handler guards WHICH pack the trace was recorded
 * against — NOT WHETHER the state is well-formed — so a forged trace carrying the
 * CORRECT content_hash and a poisoned `initial_state` previously sailed past it.
 * `Trace.initial_state` is a bare `GameState` with no Zod schema, so the same
 * three sub-holes the save arc named were reachable: (a) finiteness (1e999 ->
 * Infinity -> always-true var_gte, conditions.ts:75), (b/c) referential (a phantom
 * `current` / `endingId` renders the game from a symbol the pack never declares).
 *
 * This is the SoundnessBench (arXiv:2412.03154) rejection oracle: a checker is
 * credibly sound only if it rejects instances that are known-bad BY CONSTRUCTION.
 * Each WITNESS forges ONE field of a CLEAN recorded trace and asserts BOTH
 * `replay_trace` AND `inspect_trace` throw `SaveIntegrityError`. The GREEN
 * false-rejection guards prove a legitimate fresh-init trace — and a legitimately
 * mid-game RPG trace — still replays + inspects unchanged, so the gate never
 * false-rejects a state a real recording could carry.
 *
 * GENUINE-WITNESS NOTE: with the two-line gate reverted in BOTH tools.ts handlers,
 * the poisoned state reaches the engine and replay/inspect return WITHOUT throwing,
 * so every WITNESS case below FAILS pre-change (verified by reverting the gate).
 * These are not vacuous greens.
