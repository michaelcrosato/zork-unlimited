/**
 * Structural verification (§15) — every shipped RPG pack's SCORE ECONOMY is sound: the
 * maximum score reachable by concrete play equals the declared `max_score`, EXACTLY. The
 * RPG completion of bug_0148's parser score-economy proof, and the score analogue of the
 * bug_0145/0146/0147 variant-liveness trilogy (same exhaustive BFS, same onState hook, a
 * different property asserted at each reachable state). Together with bug_0148 this closes
 * the score-economy defect class for BOTH score-bearing modes — CYOA packs carry no
 * milestone scoring, so parser + RPG are the whole scope.
 *
 * ── The gap this closes (a defect class NO existing check covers) ────────────────────
 * The corpus already proves, exhaustively: every declared ENDING is reachable
 * (rpg_all_endings_reachable, bug_0124) and every reactive VARIANT is live
 * (rpg_variant_liveness, bug_0147). It does NOT prove the score economy is sound. Two real
 * defects slip through every current check (exactly as in the parser proof):
 *   (1) BOUNDED OVERFLOW — a misconfigured / double-counted / re-farmable award pushes the
 *       reachable score PAST the declared ceiling (a "55/50"). The exhaustive ending solver
 *       catches only an UNBOUNDED farm (the score var never settles -> the BFS hits its
 *       state cap -> a loud cappedOut). A BOUNDED over-award (two one-time awards summing
 *       above max_score, or a miscalibrated inc_var) leaves the state space finite, so the
 *       solver passes and NOTHING flags it.
 *   (2) PHANTOM POINTS — `max_score` is declared HIGHER than any route can reach (the
 *       completionist's "I finished 25/50 and there were no more points anywhere"). The
 *       reachability proof checks only WHICH endings fire, never the score AT them, so a
 *       max_score no route reaches is invisible to it.
 * One tight invariant catches BOTH directions: the maximum score observed over the COMPLETE
 * reachable region equals `pack.meta.max_score`.
 *   - reachable max  > declared -> overflow / farm / under-declared max_score   (case 1)
 *   - reachable max  < declared -> phantom points (max_score unreachably high)   (case 2)
 *   - reachable max == declared -> the economy is exactly as advertised          (sound)
 *
 * ── Why RPG is the harder mode, and how this stays SOUND ─────────────────────────────
 * CYOA and the parser stage are fully DETERMINISTIC, so the parser proof (bug_0148) mines
 * the score from a single-`Rules` BFS. RPG adds the engine's only randomness: an ATTACK
 * round draws a d6 for the player's strike and a d6 for the enemy's reply, a skill check
 * draws a d20 (src/rpg/combat.ts). So, exactly as the every-ending RPG proof (bug_0124) and
 * the RPG variant-liveness proof (bug_0147) do, this drives `exhaustiveEndingsMulti` under
 * TWO rule sets that differ only in the rolls their combat/skill resolver draws — one
 * forcing the player's BEST rolls (max strike, min damage taken, max skill roll), one their
 * WORST — and records the maximum `score` var over the union of both reachable regions.
 *
 * The soundness argument is the SCORE specialization of the bracket's monotonicity. Every
 * score award fires at one of three kinds of site:
 *   - ROLL-INDEPENDENT awards (an interaction/take/on_enter/dialogue `inc_var`) — collected
 *     by stepping the relevant non-combat action, which the BFS explores under BOTH regimes.
 *   - ROLL-WINNING awards — an enemy's `on_defeat` (fires when the enemy dies) and a skill
 *     check's `on_success` (fires when the d20 meets the difficulty). The BEST regime maxes
 *     these out: it wins every fight and passes every check, so it collects ALL of them.
 *   - ROLL-LOSING awards — a skill check's `on_failure` (fires when the d20 misses). The
 *     best regime collects NONE of these (it always passes). This is the ONE site the best
 *     regime skips, and the only way the bracket could UNDER-count the true maximum (a
 *     fail-then-retry-succeed middle path could collect a fail-award AND a success-award the
 *     two fixed extremes never collect together). There is no "survive a lost fight" award
 *     site — a fight the player loses ends at the enemy's `death_ending` (terminal), so
 *     combat contributes only roll-winning awards.
 * So if no score award rides an `on_failure`, the BEST regime alone collects every award
 * the true-maximum path collects, hence observed max (which includes the best regime) ==
 * true reachable max. The suite ASSERTS exactly that (the `scoreAwardOnFailure` guard
 * below): a future on_failure score award trips a LOUD, explained failure rather than
 * silently under-crediting into a FALSE phantom-points alarm. Both shipped packs satisfy it
 * today (every skill check's on_failure only narrates — see the "keep at it" feedback).
 *
 * ── The roll-bracket caveat (shared with bug_0124/0147), reused ──────────────────────────
 * The bracket also reaches the right STATES only if no routing condition reads a
 * roll-dependent TRANSIENT the best/worst extremes skip — a raw HP value (a middle roll can
 * land an intermediate HP the extremes never visit). RPG routes/exits/wins gate on flags /
 * items / non-HP vars / object state / visited, all reached by roll-independent actions or
 * MONOTONE combat consequences. The one way it could break is a condition gated on a raw HP
 * var, so the suite ASSERTS no pack condition reads an HP var (player `hp` or a hidden
 * `__enemy_hp_*`) — the SAME load-bearing guard rpg_all_endings_reachable / rpg_variant_
 * liveness make. Both shipped packs pass it.
 *
 * ── The action policy (shared with the liveness proofs) ─────────────────────────────────
 * The shared BFS's default (reachability) policy SKIPS READ and LOOK, but score awards can
 * ride READ effects or an authored INSPECT interaction that resolves through natural LOOK.
 * This therefore uses the bug_0146 LIVENESS action policy plus the runtime's explicit
 * authored-inspect predicate: step READ, stateful target LOOK, ATTACK, USE, and every other
 * progress action while skipping inert observations and DROP. The search FAILS on cappedOut,
 * so it can never pass by truncating an unexplored region. Every shipped pack settles under
 * the bounded cap. Wolf Winter's authored route/combat choices expand the complete bracket
 * to 665,101 states; the 800k ceiling remains a loud runaway guard with roughly 20% headroom
 * rather than an implicit truncation.
 *
 * Packs are auto-discovered from content/rpg/quests, so a new RPG pack is covered the moment
 * it ships (the health-covers-all-packs bar, bug_0096).
