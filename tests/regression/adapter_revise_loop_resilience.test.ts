/**
 * bug_0236 — author revise-loop resilience to off-shape model replies.
 *
 * `runAdaptLoop` (agents/authoring/adapter.ts) is the author → validate → revise loop
 * behind the RPG authoring path. Its only model call is `provider.completeJson(...)`,
 * which does `schema.parse(extractJson(text))`: it THROWS both when no balanced JSON
 * can be extracted (prose / fences / truncation) AND when the parsed object fails the
 * `.strict()` adapter OUTPUT schema (an extra key, a wrong shape). The deterministic
 * MockAuthorProvider never does either — but a live frontier model will.
 *
 * BEFORE this fix the throw propagated straight out of the loop, aborting the whole
 * authoring run on the offending round with a raw, unattributed error and zero retries.
 * AFTER it, a thrown completion is treated as a NON-GREEN round: it is surfaced as an
 * `ADAPTER_OUTPUT_UNPARSEABLE` error finding fed back into the next prompt (so the model
 * can revise toward valid output) and the loop continues. Only if EVERY round fails to
 * parse does the loop throw — and then with an attributable, aggregated message rather
 * than a non-null-assertion lie on a null result.
 *
 * These witnesses pin that contract: a transient bad reply self-heals (and the revise
 * prompt actually carries the parse-error feedback), while a persistent bad backend
 * fails loudly only after exhausting the round budget.
