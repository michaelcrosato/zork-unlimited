/**
 * bug_0050 — the agent-facing CODE COMMENTS stop instructing the RETIRED §14
 * human-approval ceremony as live policy (the sibling of bug_0049).
 *
 * bug_0049 fixed the last current-process DOC (docs/blind_playtest_protocol.md) that
 * still told a fresh agent to PROPOSE-ONLY and wait for a human, and logged its
 * next-focus (a)(i): the same stale phrasing also lingered in CODE COMMENTS —
 * specifically `agents/fixer.ts`, whose header said engine_rule/validator/test
 * changes "are gated (§14) and produce a proposal only — code edits stay with the
 * human supervisor", with an inline echo "engine-touching fixes are proposals only
 * (gated, §14)". Under the trust-but-verify charter (AGENTS.md — "no human-approval
 * gate and no §14 ceremony") the agent edits that code DIRECTLY, verified by the
 * automated bar. A fixer/agent reading the stale comment would refuse the authority
 * the charter grants — a stale map, not a harmless note.
 *
 * This guard scans the agent-facing code (agents/*.ts) with the SAME conservative
 * predicate the doc guard uses (src/afk/gate_coherence.ts). It is deliberately
 * conservative: the many legitimate SPEC references to the §14 engine-extension gate
 * (e.g. debugger.ts's "(§14 testing strategy)") describe what §14 IS and must NOT be
 * flagged — only imperative human-gate phrasings are.
