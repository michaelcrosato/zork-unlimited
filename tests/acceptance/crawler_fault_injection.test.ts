/**
 * Fault-injection acceptance suite (Task 9) — proves the mechanical crawler
 * actually CATCHES planted defects, end to end. Each test plants one bug in a
 * freshly generated pack (never a shipped one) using the exact mutation/wrapper
 * recipes proven in tests/unit/crawl_quest_crawler.test.ts, then asserts:
 *  (a) the crawl reports exactly the right finding code, and
 *  (b) the finding's ddmin-minimized repro trace re-triggers the SAME finding
 *      fingerprint via `reproducesFingerprint` — the repro is real, not a stub.
 *
 * Repro contract (documented on `reproducesFingerprint`, Task 6): a CRASH
 * caused by `step` itself throwing records a trace whose `actions` array OMITS
 * the triggering action (the crawler breaks before pushing it so the trace
 * stays safely replayable) — replaying the trace alone won't reproduce it, so
 * the helper appends `finding.action` when the direct replay comes up empty.
 * RENDER / INTEGRITY / PERSIST / both SOFTLOCK forms keep their trigger in the
 * trace and self-reproduce. SOFTLOCK(solver) reproduction additionally needs
 * the same solver budget the finding was produced with.
