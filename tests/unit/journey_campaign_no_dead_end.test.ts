/**
 * Exhaustive no-dead-end proof for campaign progression. Quests are not gated by the
 * active journey goal, so ANY subset of campaign quests can be complete when a goal's
 * continue is chosen. For every one of the 2^12 completion subsets this pins the
 * three-way total split the session relies on (session.ts chooseJourney + the
 * journeyCampaignPresentationContext fallback):
 *
 *   - campaign not started (wolf_winter incomplete): no next goal, no story step —
 *     the initial journey goal itself is the pending work;
 *   - campaign exhausted (every ordered post-Weir target complete): both null;
 *   - otherwise EXACTLY ONE of nextJourneyCampaignGoal (auto-activation) or
 *     journeyCampaignPendingStoryStep (a story choice must present) is available.
 *
 * If a future goal/quest edit breaks this split, the campaign can silently dead-end
 * at a continue again (the bug behind journey_campaign_out_of_order_recovery.test.ts).
